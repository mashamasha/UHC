After spending hours checking I found out that you need an iPhone 8 or 10 and that is ridiculous, it had been working for three years just fine and I can guarantee you that regular hard-working people cannot afford the latest phones. This is a terrible new system which excludes The majority of regular people with regular phones. I am a transplant patient and I need to keep up with my blood work results frequently since many levels such as my potassium could cause me heart problems from one week to another.

The services Accolade provide were in my opinion Lifesaving!!! As you could imagine, getting my diagnosis was scary and shocking. I had no idea where to start. I did not want to just start researching on the internet and risk getting bad information or how to process all the obstacles around my illness and treatment. Accolade provided me with a team of support. I spoke with nurses and medical billing experts that guided me through every question and really provided great emotional support. They really gave me the support and attention that I needed and felt like an extension of\\nof my closest family and friends. I felt safe and reassured ina regular basis. Even now, as I continue to deal with overwhelming insurance claims, my Accolade rep Allison has been so thoughtful, caring and attentive. This service is a major benefit and I am so grateful I had the people and the service in my corner during this time!',\n",

The App is easy to use, and itâ€™s easy for them to send lists of doctors you may be looking for. Itâ€™s a convenient way to communicate if your too busy to talk on the phone bc of work, etc, and itâ€™s an easy app! Thanks! KG',\n",

For example, I purchased all three apps, the Mac, iPhone, & iPad versions.  So using the Mac I input my extensive medical history into the program.  Then I setup the app on my iPhone and iMac.  Rather than iCloud  uploading the info I just put into the system, it uploaded the blank data from the newly opened app to the iCloud and deleted everything I put into my Mac app.  \\nBug # 2, I then tried to backup the app using a Continuality Care Report.  Every time I hit backup on my Mac, it locks the program up.  I can't input any data, I can't even close the app.  It is perpetually locked until I reboot my computer.  But oh wait…it won't let me do that either because the program won't close.  So basically you have to hard reboot your computer to unlock the program.\\n\\nNow, lets go over the good things.  Once you get done with the trial and error of it, it works flawlessly.  (besides the lockup described above)  It syncs, and it does the ability to save any files in the app itself.

You can email yourself a back up.  You can also email a copy of the date you have enter so you can print it out for your doctor, which is very handy.    \\n\\nA new feature in this version is iCloud; There is basically no help on this, the help is basic and only  shows you how to turn it on, it has no troubleshooting on how to get it to sync, when it will not sync; and customer service will not help unless you can pin point your question on how it's not working or not sync'n.

What could be better?\\n\\nHere's my suggestions:\\nMedications - many apps will let you pick from a list, which includes interactions, side effects, pill identification marks & even pictures. With this app you have to type in all the info yourself, no additional drug info, and you have to find & save (or take a picture of the pill) and add it yourself.\\n\\nVaccinations:\\nEverytime you add a vaccination the app adds a block. It would be better to have one block per vaccination, that shows the latest record & when you click on the box it opens to records for that vaccine, ie 1 box for polio, not 5.\\n\\nTests: would like to be able to add individual portions of tests & select which ones to compare ie WBC, without having to uncheck all the filters, only way to currently do this is enter it separately. This would also help when a dr only runs a portion of the test. For example glucose is included in CMP, but when dr only ran glucose, if i only entered it as glucose, it won't show up in the chart.\\n\\nSwitch to number pad option for entering blood work test results, also no need to open in a new window, just makes entering data slower.\\n\\nDon't need to be able to see all results when I open window, CBC boxes are long and takes a while to scroll through info. Try accordion style.\\n\\nAlso, there is no way to put in a reference range in on blood work, which would be helpful.\\n\\nA few final suggestions: add ER visits, not the same as hospitalizations; add selection tool for surgeries, why do I need a box to type in tonsillectomy; lab tests & imaging should be separated, also add facility location option for labs and imaging, blood work ran in ER may be ran by a different lab than a doctors office & X-rays & scans may be done by someone outside your PCP.\\n\\nThat's all for now, I will re-evaluate as the app is updated.\",\n",

I am a disabled veteran and have many health issues that would be a nightmare to track if not for this app.  I am able to schedule all of my Dr. Appts, Lab Appts and keep track of everything.  I also have to track 11 prescriptions plus those that I have been removed from and thanks to this app, I just email a list to the Dr. before each appt.  I am also able to keep all of my blood work and keep track of improvements and failures on the heart disease side of life.\\n\\nOne of the other great aspects to this app is that it is very easy to enter data and then back it up straight to my own email.  My info stays with me and is not stored with someone else in the world...THANKS GUYS!!!  Once backed up in multiple places/ways...it is easliy recoverable and puts me right back to where I was.  Customer Service is OUTSTANDING...a reply to any email happens in less then 2 hours based on my multiple questions/issues over the years.  I have ALWAYS had my question or issue resolved usually within the same day!\\n\\nLastly I would recommend two things...Change the App Icon...it is ugly and does not draw attention to medical personnel that there is important info available in a medical emergency.  The current icon makes it look like a \"To Do\" / \"Task\" List and not a medical information app.  I would also recommend that if a person where in a medical emergency situation that they could open the app, hit a button that would dial 911 and provide a gps location to the dispatcher.  In this way, the app would be open and if the patient became unconsious then rescue would be on the way and the app would already be open when they arrived.\\n\\nOtherwise, I HIGHLY recommend this app and will change my 4 stars to 5 when/if my recommendations are added.

The app is mostly great with merging in new data you enter using the website, but there is a problem with resolving conflicts.  If you happened to slightly change an entry both on your phone and in the web interface, the app doesn't let you know, or prompt you to resolve the conflict, it just creates two records that are slightly different.
