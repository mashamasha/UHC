Their website is a mess!
In the first place, they don't really distinguish, when setting up your account, which questions are required to set up your account and which are voluntary to help them with research. That is frustrating. A person should be able to tend to the important agreements and know they're done with those and that their account is set up before being asked what probably amounts to (not exaggerating) 10-15 hours of health questions.
In any case, realizing that somehow I'd gotten onto that treadmill and it wasn't going to end, I tried over the course of 3 days and put over 8 hours into attempting resolve a website glitch that would allow a person to choose whether they did or didn't want their sample stored for further research.

I had friends over to see if they could figure out the problem. I called and wrote to customer service.- two different branches of the company - and they didn't seem to care. Their customer service is the worst! They just refer you to their website! By the time my sample had arrived at the company, it was too late to change anything (although I did spend another 2 hours trying to do so!)

So, basically, if you're having trouble with the website, they say: Go to the website!

Specifically, I'd say, ""Hey, I'm having trouble with this link. It's not taking me to the page where I can choose to have my sample stored! My friends have come over to see if I'm an idiot or what the problem is, we've spent hours and hours trying to solve this... Here's the browser I'm using, blah, blah..."" and probably no less than 15 times, I was referred to the link that wasn't working, or a different one that linked to it and then asked to rate their customer service!""

It was infuriating!

I've ordered this for myself and two other members of my family - I ordered theirs first as gifts - so I was obligated to use 23andMe but they're are just really bad at the business end; which is probably typical for a company run by scientists."

My husbands was received December 8th. His results came in on around January 15th. I still not have received mine though it is, just barely, still within the timeline of 6-8 weeks.

That said, I've viewed the results for my husband and it's very interesting to look through. I think we knew what we were going to see and weren't surprised to get the results he did. The predisposition to diseases was at least an interesting read, though they stress that environment and other factors play a big role in your chances of actually acquiring any of the mentioned diseases/disorders.

UPDATE: On the first day over 8 weeks, I sent an email to customer support saying that I hadn't seen any progress from essentially step 2 after they receive it and just wanted an update. I received a very courteous response saying that they were moving my sample to the front and that I would be receiving a free code for another kit! I received my results on Feb 14th - almost 10 weeks later. I definitely expected a little delay since I sent in around the holidays and really wasn't in any hurry since the data wasn't going to change, just very curious. I appreciate the fantastic customer service. I've read that people are very frustrated with them when they email before the 8 weeks demanding updates, but that is what the slider on the homepage is for - to provide updates.

It is so easy to do, you just spit into a tube, fill it to a line, cap it, then send it off! My results came back in about seven weeks, and was surprisingly very accurate. It seems that the more diverse your ancestral profile is, the less satisfaction you'll have with it. Mine was straight 50/50, so there was no ambiguity about it. The results are further broken down into specific global regions of your ancestry origins. I found it to be extremely helpful. The traits, diseases and other information was also straightforward and easy to read. It's a quality kit with fantastic information. I've had suspicions about my ancestral origins, and the results proved them correct. What I really liked was the results pinpointed on a time line, specific years of ancestry, so you can plot migration patterns. Mine went back to the 1700's Native Americans, then migrated out to Eastern Asia around 1800. It mentioned my 3rd or 4th grandfather was most likely from a specific region of a specific country, and the approximate years he was alive. Very cool! BUY IT.

For me, I got 99.9% South Asian. Are you kidding me? I could have said that without a $200 DNA test. For a population of over 1.3 billion people in India alone, 23andme can't find a proper DNA analysis for this population? Are they THAT lazy? For British Isles, or other small islands in Europe they could provide a detailed analysis of it including tiny regions.

I did a Genographic Project DNA test two years ago and that was more detailed that 23andme's terrible DNA result. 40% South East Asian, 30% South West Asian, 14% Mediterranean, 4% Northern European among others. Not only that, I was 2% Neanderthal and 3% Denisovan.

None of these results were on 23andme. Just 99.9% South Asian. I could have looked in the mirror to know that.

Sorry about my language, but that's what it is. A LAZY DNA test. Such a waste of my money and time.

I will not recommend 23andme to anybody. It's so White Anglo Saxon centric. 23andme should invest some more money for research of different population samples before going around advertising their product further."

I also do not trust my results at all. There results that are coming up are showing me only one last name ( out of 977 results) that is familiar on my list of relatives. It’s Clark. It doesn’t show that I have any Native American or Scottish ancestry even though my mom is atleast 80% Scottish.

It took three weeks to get the test back (end of June) when I was expecting it in August. I called the help line and it goes straight to a man in India that barely could understand me and said there is no way any mistakes could be made. He yelled this at me after I questioned him.

I mostly took this test to get the health results. I know my family and I know up to third cousins on almost all the branches. I’m German Scottish English and Irish With a pinch of Native American. I am going to keep emailing until someone can help me. I hope others don’t go through this."

Now here is where it gets a bit crappy. 23andme outsources the testing to LabCorp (for multiple and legit reasons that is actually beneficial to you the customer) though they had some security issues that required some down time which meant some holdups on processing, some redirecting of packages to another lab, etc... though they are horrible about communicating these delays and just give you cookie cutter responses instead of an honest explanation as to what is going on. If you ever need to call them you get outsourced call service which I honestly did not even waste my time with and automatically asked for someone in the states. Luckily my sample only ran in to two delays, both of which were fixed within about a week each so not as horrible as some other people. Do expect this to take the full 6-8 weeks they ask for though you might get lucky and get it in 4. They do seem to have resolved their issues though and are catching back up so this may no longer be an issue. Do I still recommend this?

If you're looking for medical information (not just ancestry), you are getting your money's worth.

This is true for all DNA testing companies when it comes to medical information. The good news is that you can upload your 23andMe data to other websites and receive detailed reports. Promethease.com gives you detailed reporting for just $5 - everything from vulnerabilities to diseases, to genes associated with personality traits. Another commenter mentioned the MTHFR mutations, which are associated with many chronic illnesses. Geneticgenie.org will run your 23andMe results specifically related to these genes, and the report is free. And if you can afford it, the best way to interpret your results is to make an appointment with a genetic counselor, who you can find through NSGC.org.

Martin Ashburn was an Ensign in the Knox Regiment of volunteers that destroyed the Chicamaugas in the Fall of 1794. Group of 500 men pursued a group of renegades that had  murdered settlers along the Holston and French Broad Rivers after receiving from George Washington ~ $5,000 under a treaty agreement. The Group elected James Ore the commander who was Martin A.â€™s brother-in-law. president Washington wanted only the miscreants punished. group arrived near present day Chattanooga on the North side of the Tennessee River and were about to return home empty handed when a white captive living with the Chicamaugas for seven years (16yrs old) offered to help the Group engage the Indians by surprise. Cherokees sued for peace. never again attacked settlers as as tribe. The battle was remembered as the Running Waters, Cave and Lookout mountain campaign.
Martin settled in the Sequatchie Valley in 1815.

4 stars for the blood collection process.

Improvements would include instructions outside of the box so you can read what the process entails prior to collection. Even if they are printed on the box still sealed.

My biggest issue was the collection vial didn't have a distinct edge/lip where u can scrape the blood off your finger. Mine took 3 pricks before I got good blood flow and by then it was sticky and clotting. I couldn't scrape the blood into the vial bc there was was a thin blood bubble blocking it and blood was running everywhere but into the collection vial. It was a total mess bc of this. However, maybe had I done the prick on the outside of my ring finger first it would have gone a lot smoother and avoiding this issue entirely.

Overall, I would purchase again since the results were accurate in my case.

Tip: With my experience my ring finger, on the side by my pinky in the fatty part, was the best place to prick.
