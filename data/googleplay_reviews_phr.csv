The Higi Website should also be 90% open sourced, as it has some of the same problems as the Android app.   Most importantly, the Higi Stations themselves are a reprobate festival of bugs. It is a shame that the Android app give you your weight with 2 digits of precision, but totally refuses to do so at the measurement station.   The measurement stations fail to ask you or give you 3 random choices for what you think your clothing weight is.   AND THE HIGI SCIENCE (acceptable blood pressure differentials for age) should also be open sourced. Higi stations are out of compliance with the currently acceptable EU standards for BP measurement.   The Systolic vs Diastolic are actually less important than the difference between the two.

Once I added my sign on info I had all of health info in one place.  On the downside, the formatting of the data pulled from the doctors is still a bit rough, and many of the items have no data inside them.  I'm sure that will improve over time.

UPDATE: I contacted support and was told 1) that despite sending a screenshot of the import file and the sleep records inside their tool with incorrect values after import, they could NOT see the problem. Basically, sleep records import has a bug in it that they will not acknowledge so you'll have to manually edit the bedtime and awake time for each entry after import; 2) it will take 7 to 10 days to see the synced records in the Fitbit app despite running hourly updates. This is unacceptable for me; 3) My concern about the 4+ hour delay to see the Google Fit data was not addressed; 4) As I stated above, I was told it will be 7 to 10 days before the updates synced TO fitbit yesterday will be visible in the Fitbit app. I'm back to wearing two devices on my wrist because this app doesn't work as expected PREVIOUS REVIEW: Sort of works 2) 1) After importing Sleep records, I had to manual correct the hours for Bedtime & Awake times; minutes and date were correct but all times showed the hour as midnight. 2) Hourly/automatic sync does not update any records for Google Fit or Fitbit. I have to manually update and add manual entries which makes the Pro version only semi-useful 3) 4hr delay to retrieve my Google Fit data 4) Fitbit push/sync has stopped working or is experiencing a 12+ hr delay"

Support is very responsive if you run into issues.  I'm using about 10 different tasks and all of them work great.

Well, it turns out there are no other data sources. There is just two-way communication between Samsung Health and FitnessSyncer. What the app does do is create nice charts using your Samsung Health data. However, the free version is very limited with the data it will pull, and I just don't see enough value to upgrade to paid.  UPDATE: The developer has obviously put in a lot of work since my initial review, but this app is still not at ready for prime time. One example, Google Fit authorization returned an error message that the app is blocked. Other apps have only certain data that it will pull, and pulling the info doesn't mean you can sync it to another app like Samsung Health. I guess it is fine if all you want is to dump all your info on the FitnessSyncer website, but I don't really know why someone would do that or pay for it."

The whole point or marketing strategy of the app is the service they provide with saving time and costs. This is not what you will experience. You will spend more money on a consultation that is not valuable and then you'll still have to go to your PCP or another provider. In addition you'll spend more time which is ultimately the worse.

What is this giant visual in the middle of my screen and what is its purpose? I don't care about some Google specific point system, I want an app that makes tracking, and compiling fitness data, easier. Preferably using metrics that can be referenced when speaking to a doctor, personal trainer, or coach. Texhnically, I'm fine with the extra point system as an added motivation but it shouldn't be such an invasive part of the app. Not only is the data hard to find, it seems less accurate. Can I just have old version? Also why doesnt this version sync with my Aware app anymore?"

Accuracy is high and all movement unrelated to car or motorbike travel has been captured.

I'm looking for an app that is useful when you see a new doctor - like the forms you have to fill out with your history.  This app is more for keeping track of your doctors.  Probably the problem is more the medical system (if you want to call the mishmash  we have a system) that we have than the app.  It just isn't going to work for me.

Spend significant time updating records to be accurate through the end of 2016. Lo and behold when I opened the app earlier this year, I saw 3 separate records for myself and my dad. In other words, the information seemed to by triplicated. However upon inspection the records did not match each other. For example they all had a different number of entries for blood pressure AND none was more recent than 2015. Lost an entire year of information and the remaining information was so corrupted I couldn't make heads or tails out of it. I send messages to customer support on 3 occasions and never heard anything. To bad. Do yourself a favor and don't use this."

That should be a priorty to fix. As well on my Galaxy  Edge S6 and my wife's Galaxy Note 5 it won't recognize the archives.  So backup can be lost even though its there. We've saved them to phones and tried to install as well as my wife emailed her copy (she uses it as well) but could not get the app to recognize its own file. This is also major problem. However even with these issues 1 major plus that makes this awesome... the ER doctor knew about it and loves it. She had learned about it 2 weeks ago and thinks everyone should use it. Especially if you have medical conditions. Overall, there's issues but I'm betting they'll get fixed. This app has real potential to help."

There aren't a lot of competing products, which is unfortunate, because I think this software would improve significantly if there were. That said, I still find it a very nice application. I have not had the data loss problems others mention, but I'm careful to back up my device, and have restored the records on device change. So what's wrong with it? 1. The bmi is not linked to your vital statistics record of your weight, you must separately update your ""official"" weight under general, as well as your height, rather than using the latest entry there. 2. There is no ability to filter results by date or similar criteria, important when you have been recording test results for a long period of time to demonstrate ""this is what happens when you put me on this medication."" 3. Send to other device only seems to support sending the entire dataset, not just a single individual in the record set. 4. The handling of medications could be improved. One may be taken off a medication, then put back on it. We should be able to record multiple start/stop dates. Currently, the workaround is to duplicate the medication entry."
