FitnessSyncer,1159207899,2.5,5,Broken: needs to be updated,devinhedge,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id41659403,0,0,1,"Upon initial install under previous version of iOS, this app seemed just thing needed to sync my Apple Health information to Fitbit, so I purchased the Pro plan and away it synced.

Upon updating both my iPhone, and reinstalling the app for good measure, the app presents me with a blank, black screen before dying after about 30s. Background syncing wasn't happening, instead I was being prompted via notification to launch and manually sync.

The UI isn't that great but is functional. 

CONCLUSION: fix the app.",2017-04-17T04:46:59-07:00

I love the layout, ease of use and attention to detail. It reminds me of google health which was discontinued. This app is in many ways better than google health which I felt was the best available a few years ago.
      If you use this app then please give them your input. These guys are into CQI (continuous quality improvement) and they always want to make it better.
        I love the way you can email your entire record. I can see this app allowing download of lab results etc in the future.",2013-10-08T18:55:18-07:00

Kaiser Permanente,493390354,3.0,1779,Map feature not useful,Verlan roylee,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id161341568,0,0,1,"I have not tried to login yet but the map feature made me wonder if it is worth even trying. It took a couple of minutes for the app to become minimally responsive.

One major criticism of the map filter is that it does not list Kaiser's Urgent Care facilities. The Map Search does not pick up keywords so searching for 'urgent' sent me to Urgench, Uzbekistan! 

The filter allows one to choose Amenities or Other Services but does not give a second menu to further refine a search. 

Their website locator is not great but is better than this so no reason for this app to waste space on my phone.",2014-08-12T06:36:19-07:00
