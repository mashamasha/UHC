After spending hours checking I found out that you need an iPhone 8 or 10 and that is ridiculous, it had been working for three years just fine and I can guarantee you that regular hard-working people cannot afford the latest phones. This is a terrible new system which excludes The majority of regular people with regular phones. I am a transplant patient and I need to keep up with my blood work results frequently since many levels such as my potassium could cause me heart problems from one week to another. I hope someone gets back in touch with me or I will be switching lab companies who can supply a simple task as supplying blood work results which I pay for.",2018-08-08T05:03:25-07:00

My reliance on their products is a lifetime relationship since the days of MS-DOS I been a computer practitioner using them from a blog to a multimillion deal. I get irritated on the manuals when the independent authors on their manuals indicate clears instructions on how to use the product and on the same page there are instructions for Microsoft and a couple of paragraphs with instructions for an apple product. It is a distraction and it never occurred to them to put all the instructions for apple on a chapter by itself or st the end manual.

No dates. None. So I open a diagnostic result thinking it's a follow up, get excited that the result looks awesome, then realize it was years old. Then I went looking for the updated result, which should be in here by now. I was no where. You guys have a professional liability to patients accessing their own medical records. This app could actually create problems for management of chronic conditions. You either need to remove the lab results function completely, or you need to fix it completely. I'm not saying that as a random complainer, indignant over a bad product. I'm saying that as a person who provides care in the medical field and I am horrified at the idea that patients (including me, briefly) might trust this app. If I were giving out medical information in this format, my malpractice company would be ripping their hair out.",2017-01-27T11:24:12-07:00
Microsoft HealthVault,546835834,2.5,176,Stuck in 2001 health reporting technology,mjdindc,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id37433209,1,1,1,"I started using almost 10 years ago. For the time it was innovative. There has been virtually no functionality added or improved while there are new sites coming up fast and furious. HealthVault is primed to be a major player by being the connection point between many of the systems. Instead it relies on you to manually enter the data. It’s easier to save as pdf and stick it in the cloud. 

Some data does come over from insurance and pharmacies but it’s hit and miss so you never know what to trust. There is no way to sort so drugs are missed up randomly. Conditions are duplicated numerous times. 

It pulls over some lab procedures but no results and the fields are not properly set up to enter them. It would be simple to set up lab fields and just let users enter so they can tracks but instead it just a bunch of random fields that don’t allow for any comparison",2018-01-16T21:08:55-07:00

The reason I'm writing is to complain to Microsoft of two issues I just encountered and wanted to report to them so they could resolve these issues but just like all of Microsoft's products there is no way to contact them to complain. I just now tried to add data to my ""emotional state"" under trackers and the app crashed, and I tried to add data within ""heart rate"" under measurements and that too crashed the app. But even if Microsoft resolved these two of many problems there is still the practical issue of this product. I cannot share this data with anybody especially my doctor's office. Yesterday I had an appointment with my cardiologist and I frequently referenced this app for dates of procedures, medications, etc. and he wanted to know what I was referencing and I showed him. He said I had phenomenal records that he wished he could access, but he also noted there was no way to upload my digital X-rays, lab reports, and any other diagnostic reports from his office to my app which I wanted, so instead I have handfuls of CD ROMs that I have to open on my laptop instead of my app. This app just has very little to any practical usefulness other than recording medications, contact info, and lists of encounters and procedures.

UI is clearly not optimized for Plus phones 
Support link takes me to a web browser which gives me a certificate warning before presenting me with a popup for a username and password. Unacceptable. 
No summary view of health stats

In the end, I'm not sure what this is supposed to be. It's far too buggy and the certificate warning doesn't feel at all ""vault""-like and the UI doesn't remotely compete with Fitbit's or Apple's health apps. 

I'm still unclear how I'm supposed to use this. Is this for fitness tracking, as hinted by the list of apps it ties into? If so, why can't I track explicitly within the app? 

Is it for sharing medical information with my doctor? It seems to have the relevant data, but no clear way to do it. 

This seems like a solution looking for a problem, but the solution itself is problematic. 

Microsoft, you can do better, especially if you want me to trust you with my medical information. I look forward to you incorporating my feedback in future iterations, but this product is not up to par with your recent Surface Book and Windows 10 wins.",2015-10-26T21:34:31-07:00
Microsoft HealthVault,546835834,2.5,176,Start of something great...left unfinished!,Flash.Gordon57,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id141119091,1,1,2,"I've been using HealthVault (HV) on the Web (desktop and iPad), and iPhone for 2-3 years. I love what has been started... really! I have ongoing health issues, that keep me in the medical system frequently. 

Currently, where it help most is keeping a current medication list. Then, I can easily print a copy for my wife, in case of emergency. And run off copies when I'm going to the doctor, so I don't have to write it all down, or verbally go over it. They love it! 

Medication History, being one of the most frequently used features, is also the weakest feature, at least that I'm aware of, in the iOS version. It shows you EVERYTHING YOU'VE EVER ENTERED, with no way to filter it to the current melds. If they aren't going to allow filtering at this time, they should at least make the only available display be CURRENT mess only. Then it would be helpful.

The whole mobile app needs to be tossed, and a team that knows how to design data-driven mobile sites, should help a great UI designer start with a blank sheet. There is nothing in the old one id want to salvage, nor would I want to tether them with the old code. 

The HV website has gotten enough traction that several of the health / exercise-related IoT devices, will automatically update HV from their own update site. THAT'S how things should work! And it was super easy to set-up. I had my FitBit, and Withings device talking together with MyFitnessPal in no time. So, let's build on the good...

HV needs to be proactive in writing connections to the major EMR systems (both clinical, and hospital), lab systems, radiology systems, and pharmacy management systems. If the took the top three players in each category, and wrote import connections from the healthcare provider-side into HV, probably 80% of all our medical records could be imported directly from the provider's system. This would be incredible, compared to hand-input, or scanning in information.

I could go on and on with ideas on where to go with HealthVault...but they haven't asked me. ğŸ˜�

I'm not to the point of throwing it out yet, but I so wish this didn't seem like an orphan in Redmond.",2015-09-25T17:59:23-07:00

Andaman7 was the best alternative I found , but the lab tracking leaves much to be desired.

We are all appreciative of the local only data storage and no Internet connection required.

Two gotchas at this point (01/08/2018) with version 2.0.1 (iPad): a) no direct contact with any application support personnel, b) Dropbox and local network HTTP functionality doesn’t appear to work. Use of Dropbox pops up authorization window but no backup is ever performed (screen blinks after allowing access and then drops back to Capzule). Initiating local network transfer fails as Capzule never opens up the designated port.

b) HTTP connectivity: issue resolved - desktop multi-network control sequence

I would like to see a way to remove data. I track my blood sugar and insulin usage daily. That’s 365 entries in a year and all I really need access to is the most recent 90-120 entries. Maybe a way to delete by date range? Or even a way to quickly mark a screen full of entries to delete. 

Finally, I would like to store templates separately from my data. Lacking a way to mass delete data, I was thinking I could copy a template into self monitoring and call it Diabetes 2017, then copy it in as Diabetes 2018 and simply delete 2017 at some point. Thanks!",2017-11-27T17:30:08-07:00

Very useful & largely functional. But one concern is always, how to make sure your info is secure beyond just living on your phone? 

I like to backup to a separate iPad when possible using Dropbox. That quit working a few weeks ago. The developer released an upgrade that was supposed to fix that. But now when I try the backup, I get sent to my Dropbox app to approve Capzule’s access. When I click to Allow, I get sent right back to the Capzule app with no backup happening. Try the backup again, get sent back to Dropbox again to allow access. OVER AND OVER. Something is not communicating right between those two. Please help!

Edit to add: developer contacted me, I can’t respond by e-mail or on their website though - only though the App Store on my phone, which I hate. Anyway: tried closing and launching both apps in various orders, same result. Deleted Dropbox & re-installed it, same result. Tap settings -> cloud symbol under Backup -> Dropbox; Dropbox launches and says “Capzule PHR Free would like access to files & folders in your Dropbox” -> tapping Allow causes the “Authorizing” box to momentarily appear, then Capzule reopens to the account page and the News folder flashes blue two times... but the only message in the folder is the Version 2.0.1 announcement.

This app does all that. Not surprisingly, the actual data entry is a pain, but that has nothing to do with the app. Finding all those pill bottles, blood tests, etc is necessary for this to work properly. (You can enter data from your address book effortlessly) But once the data is in, sharing and/or updating becomes easy. This is a smart app, in that it anticipates from already entered data what you may need when updating. I bought the iPad app to enter and keep the data up to date, and the iPhone app for ease of use and portability when visiting the doctor. Yes, you need to buy each. But syncing is easy. Once you're at a medical office, if you wold rather not narrate a record, you can just email it straight from the app to the medical office. In a couple of seconds, they have your info. 
BTW, support is great. I had a problem - turns out it was a user issue, not the app - and I had a support email back in a few hours with the correct solution.

There are currently several issues, the date time entry being particularly annoying. Correspondence to developer on issues is not answered. 

A reliable platform is required for my medical data, this program seems to no longer meet that need due to lack of response by the developer.  The most recent update Nov 2017 failed to address issue with date and time of office visits , entry does not correct time and date on app or calendar.

To troubleshoot the issue I deleted the app and reinstalled it. I tried to log and sync to Dropbox to no avail. So tried logging into my Dropbox account directly using the Dropbox app and was able to successfully log in. From there I could see all of the folders that My Medical had created. So I know the data is in Dropbox and that I can access the access. That only leaves an issue with the My Medical app. About a month ago I emailed for support with the same info and I have not received a reply back and there have been no updates to the app.,2017-12-05T06:36:28-07:00

What is a BIG negative is that there appears to be no way to backup this precious data. (1 star)  You can't do it in iCloud.  Somewhere, a brief note popped up that said it could be done in Dropbox. However, when I tried that, another note popped up from the app that said it could not backup to an old Dropbox platform.  I don't know what that means.  Within the last two months, I upgraded my Dropbox to 1TB.

I am confused by those Who have given the app low ratings. My only experience with support has been outstanding. This app is all I need now when I go into a doctors office for the first time. Doctors love the thoroughness and emergency medical personnel or even more impressed.  I have had to use the app in emergency and regular doctor visit situations so I know where of I speak.  And no I am not related to the developer!

[Original review]

Has a wonderful variety of options to input everything you need to remember.  I have been carryinging a medical history for a year now on paper.  This has me ready to give up the paper and just carry my phone with a medical symbol sticker on the case.  I especially like the web site this app allows you to use to enable easier loading of data.  My only suggestion would be to add an ability to mark certain pills and doctors to appear in groupings for specific chronic treatment issues rather than to have to check all areas for what might otherwise be referenced through a special sub folder on diabetes for example.  I have already shared this app with one of my doctors and he loved it. 

Been using for over a year now and still love it!!  I have used it when visiting new doctors and checking into the hospital.  They have all been most impressed with how organized I am.  I tell everyone I meet who has a complex medical history or parents they assist or children whose immunizations they need to track about this app.  Best money I ever spent in the app store!

I've now been using this app for three years and still consider it the best money I ever spent on an app. There have been some issues along the way. So before turning on or off synching or such, be sure to back up data. The one time I needed to use it, it worked like a charm. Still highly recommended.",2017-07-21T02:14:19-07:00

My Medical,347860026,3.5,679,Look no further.  There is nothing better.,Margolovestravel,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id168128553,0,0,5,"For some time I have been looking for a comprehensive and detailed app to monitor my labs and medication adjustments, and a chronology of doctor and hospital visits for my aging mother.  Since I travel a lot I often need this info. at my fingertips. Well a friend sent me an article in a weekly paper that highlighted the iphone app called My Medical. I cannot be more pleased. For one thing, I can add my whole family to the app. I have myself, my mother, my husband (and I'm on his iPhone after I told him to get this app). I even have our two dogs. It may sound crazy, but it's important to have their information like anyone else's.

The second thing that sets the My Medical app apart from any other is the way it is organized. The layout is simply wonderful and wonderfully simple. There is nothing to learn. Everything is in precisely the right place and at the same time, it seems to include everything I could possibly need. And that is no simple feat. I've tried other apps like this and they either don't do enough or they're utterly impossible to use. I love that I can list my meds separately from my previous history. I love charting out my weight...when it's going down :)  The form to email off various sections to my internist is priceless.  There are so many other gems inside this app that I cannot mention them all. You just need to try it for yourself. You will not be disappointed.",2011-06-21T17:03:18-07:00
My Medical,347860026,3.5,679,Nearly Perfect PHR App,Lesley11,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id35101960,0,0,4,"I have this app on the Mac, iPhone, and iPad.  It is a very powerful app with significant functionality.  It allows you to enter and track your diagnoses, meds, test results, vitals, appointments, etc.  It accesses your contacts and calendar, so you can enter your office visits once and have them appear in your calendar.  It also has the functionality for you to track multiple people within your family, so is great for those of us dealing with aging parents and/or children.

Two things would make this a five star app.  Medication reminders and a better syncing solution.  While the app lets you enter all your meds and reminds you when to fulfill a prescription, it doesn't have notifications of when you are supposed to take your meds each day.  I still have to use a separate app for that.

In terms of syncing, I understand that iCloud was problematic.  However, the Mac version allows you to store your data on Dropbox.  I don't understand why the iOS versions also don't let you access that data from Dropbox, which would keep everything seamlessly in sync.  The current ""send/receive over the same WiFi network"" functionality is clunky and runs the risk of having data loss.",2013-07-03T02:28:09-07:00
My Medical,347860026,3.5,679,LOVE this app!!,BloreanTex,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id15989842,3,3,5,"This app is well worth the money! Having gone through cancer treatment this past year, I had a LOT of medical items to keep track of: doctors, medications, test results, etc. This app is great for compiling everything you need into one place. Each time I visited a new doctor, I had gobs of paperwork to fill out that required so much information: who's your primary physician? What meds are you taking now? etc. All I had to do was open this app and everything I needed was in one place! No more searching through my contacts for each doctor's contact info. This app will pull all of your doctor contact info from your iphone contacts app so no need to retype anything. Plus, you can fill out all of your additional information on your computer and then sync it to your phone (the website does not store your personal data. It's just a conduit). It's much easier to use a full keyboard than the iPhone keyboard. This app has really made life so much easier. Don't hesitate to buy this app. Just do it.

My Medical,347860026,3.5,679,Not what I was hoping for,Pookie1717,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id141184855,3,3,1,"I'm disappointed in this app. It is difficult to navigate and it has no category for your history. It has a category for family history...where preset choices are offered i.e. cancer, high blood pressure, diabetes, etc that you can check off for your parents, siblings, etc , but it doesn't have that category for you....the patient...to record YOUR medical background with preset choices.  i find that odd.  

also, no easy way to input lab results or monitor BP.  The office visit section is also weird. It would be nice to keep a record of office visits already completed, ..but with this app, ones that are already finished are in with the ones that are in the future.  Really annoying.  The reminders for those appointments only go back two days. Many of my appointments are for next year...mammograms, annual physicals, and are not able to be made yet. It would be nice to have a reminder about these three months in advance so that I can call for the appointments. Many doctor offices do not make appointments a year in advance and you have to remember to do it at a later date.  Having a reminder two days before isn't helpful. 

I'm sorry I bought this app and wished I had researched further.",2012-08-15T06:37:20-07:00
My Medical,347860026,3.5,679,Suggestions,Pax43,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id13515953,0,0,5,"I just started using this app in February 2014. Seems okay, most reviewers that have been using an app of this type seem to love it over others that are available. 
 Two suggestions that I'd like to see. The first one is searchability, it would be nice to search a term, or search for a doctor, or search for something you know has been filed, you're just not sure where it was filed.
My second suggestion would be:  When adding information such as blood pressure in test and procedures, it would be nice if we could have that test with our default unit. 
For example- Currently when adding blood-pressure I have to go and add the number then I have to click on units and find mmHg. It would be so much easier if I could set mmHg as my standard for this input. Another example would be heart rate, having to select bpm, slows down the input of information.
Please give your app the ability to have our predetermined units show up by default on these tests and procedures.",2014-02-19T05:52:11-07:00

One if it's nice features is (was) that it automatically enters office visits in my calendar through iCloud. Now, they're changing to DropBox so I will be changing to another app. If you are a fan of DropBox and aren't concerned by its security issues, this is a very useful app. If you're an iOS device user, not so much. You might want to keep looking. The one technical design change that I would recommend is the ability to easily move prescriptions from current to old status. Otherwise, it's a great way to track and record your medical information.
Update:
There is now a way to change the status of prescriptions from current to old. No problem. They keep saying that iCloud synch is going to be taken away but haven't done it so far, so I'll keep using it. If not for the iCloud vs. Dropbox issue, I would give this app 5 stars.

I have been through app after app looking for one that I can completely rely on. It is a very large database that can handle complete medical histories and files. No more switching between documents, spreadsheets, special app for this and that. The wait is over. There are two other critical solutions with this: it exports to numerous formats and files, and it can be synchronized and backed up very easily. It can export to the medical standard ccr file that can be imported to other medical databases when/if necessary. It is synched through iCloud. It can be backed up as one file to any place you desire. You can transfer via WiFi (on the same network). Look no further. This is what you need. The developers listen and respond.

In fact, I'm seeing a new doctor tomorrow and its so easy to send emails to myself and just print the records to bring with me.  I have two requests that would make it even better:
1) I keep a separate app for my prescriptions and refill dates because it will do push notifications (the red circles) to alert me that I need to reorder.  I really like this.  If you could add that to your app I would use your app exclusively.
2). I took the time to enter 15 years of test results for a couple things that are important for me to track.  I love being able to see a graph of the data but would like it even more if I could select a date range for the graph.. ie 2008-present.   
I really love this app overall and if you take the time to enter data it is so helpful as I always have my phone with me, wherever I go!

YES,harringg,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id35009747,1,1,5,"I've been tracking these vitals in a combination of Excel, Access and Word, BP tracking apps, etc...  This app has it all in one place.  I really like the feature that if entering multiple meds, the Prescription information, once entered in Current Medications, is just a click away for repeat entries (ie. same pharmacy).  Makes data entry quick and easy.  Graphs are easy to read, emailed reports are very logically organized and readable (not just a raw data-dump of the information).  If you need to track yours or family members vitals, this is the app to get!  This app alone saved me money on several stand-alone (specific to a given vital record) tracking apps I was looking at.

Password protection is important and I like the fact that even when it's locked, if someone finds you and your phone, they can access the Emergency contact information without a password.

4 stars because I would like to see it lock on exit (unless it's an iPhone 4 multitask thing I haven't figured out yet).  I have to quit using the double-click and minus, otherwise everytime I just return the home screen and come back it's still unlocked.

I used the website to download that info onto my iphone and all went well. The trouble started when I tried to use the iCloud to sync updates from the phone to the iPad. After several unsuccessful attempts and having to reenter data, I turned off the iCloud in apps on both devices. Then I used the iPhone backup feature to produce an email which I opened from the iPad. The restore choice I used first was ""Add information to"" the existing profile, but that produced some duplicate entries. So instead I deleted the outdated profile on the iPad and used the ""Create a new profile"" option when restoring from the same email. It worked great except I lost my documents! So I created a new profile containing only documents called ""Mom's Documents"". The docs are now protected and I can at least keep the devices in sync.

My Medical,347860026,3.5,679,Bugs Galore,TheatrePatron,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id175307849,0,0,3,"This app has the potential to be the best medical app I've ever seen.  But there are some bugs.  

Bug # 1, if you choose to use iCloud sync…which ever app you turn icloud on last is what will be uploaded to the cloud.  For example, I purchased all three apps, the Mac, iPhone, & iPad versions.  So using the Mac I input my extensive medical history into the program.  Then I setup the app on my iPhone and iMac.  Rather than iCloud  uploading the info I just put into the system, it uploaded the blank data from the newly opened app to the iCloud and deleted everything I put into my Mac app.  
Bug # 2, I then tried to backup the app using a Continuality Care Report.  Every time I hit backup on my Mac, it locks the program up.  I can't input any data, I can't even close the app.  It is perpetually locked until I reboot my computer.  But oh wait…it won't let me do that either because the program won't close.  So basically you have to hard reboot your computer to unlock the program.

Now, lets go over the good things.  Once you get done with the trial and error of it, it works flawlessly.  (besides the lockup described above)  It syncs, and it does the ability to save any files in the app itself.  No need to keep redundant copies on your computer (be warned though) I wouldn't delete any files you have on your computer until the bugs are worked out).",2012-07-06T15:54:57-07:00

It handles the dose, side effects, and there's even a section for previous medications. At my last appointment I even handed the phone to my doctor for him to read my meds himself instead of me trying to tell him. The app is clearly well thought out. 

I also like how the app looks just like the iPhone’s own apps, for instance the Contacts app.  It has the same look and same way of inputting my info. There's no learning curve to use this app, no clutter, no confusion. I keep extensive records in some sections and as little as I need in other.

Particular kudos on the lab results section.  I like how you can specify different lab scans: x-ray, cat scan or mri. The cholesterol assessment is equally well done.",2012-07-26T07:47:56-07:00

I might not have noticed had it not been part of MyMedical. 
It is the best and most used APP I have. As ratings go, I rarely give out 4 stars and I've never given 5 until now. 

• It is easy to use either on your device or on your PC. 
• When you have questions ASK. 
• When you have input, GIVE. 
• There is a real person at the other end who listens and responds. 
• The APP is continually improving and becoming more robust. 

Very impressive. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS APP TO THE FOLLOW PEOPLE:
1: Would like to track their own medical information (especially those like me who see 6 specialists a week and can't keep up with meds)
2: Anyone with achool age children. Keeping track of vaccinations, their last visit to the dentist, and eye doctor.  
3: Anyone who cares for an elderly person (parent, grandparent): keep their information handy; their doctors information, Medications RX #s, Pharmacy, dosage, schedule, last time it was filled, allergy alerts, insurance/Medicare info, etc. 
4: Anyone interested in collecting their Family Medical History. It's important to ask everyone now, more important to document it and MOST important to consistantly update and distribute.",2010-03-05T15:20:06-07:00

Recently I was in a doctor's office and the nurse was asking my about medications. I pulled out my iPhone and opened My Medical and showed her the list. She was in awe, and said ""why can't everyone do that?""

The only complaint I have is about syncing (hence the 4 stars). Syncing is via Dropbox, which is fine. However, there are times when new entries don't sync or take a long time to sync (like 24 hrs or more). Other times new entries will sync within minutes or even seconds. If something doesn't sync, you can transfer the info by exporting over WiFi, but you have to do this for each device individually.

The additional section could be just for notes, and I would designate the issue. For example, NOTES ON MIGRAINES or NOTES ON ARTHRITIS. I would be able to keep track of new medications I have tried and how well the are working. Even without this feature this app is extremely useful.

It was starting to become very unmanageable. I found this app in the nick of time. I am pleased with its concept, function and design. The e-mail entry and backup is an essential component. Charting is a nice feature as well.

I had a small hiccup with pharmacy phone numbers.  When I would attempt to add a pharmacy phone number to prescriptions I was faced with a list of six numbers and could not figure out which number was for which pharmacy.  Then I re-entered all the info with the number first and name following it so I could choose the appropriate number.

I needed somewhere to enter an expiration date for prescriptions and e-mailed Steven, the developer.  I received a reply within a few hours and found out that it is already in the works for the next update!  Also an alert for upcoming expiration dates is coming.  Six stars!   

One other wish I have would be for an extra field for notes to give a little more flexibility.  That would be seven stars!

I don't like the fact you have to buy a version for the iphone/ipod and yet another for the ipad. They're sort of an expensive app and if it was universal, it would be worth it. But I'm not convinced having it on all devices and buying it fo each one is worth it at all. It's not an app you're likely to use daily or even weekly or monthly unless you doctor a lot.

Many doctors now put records online for their patients. So one might question the need for an app like this. But, for now at least, I think it's nice to have on at least one of your devices.",2013-10-19T05:10:54-07:00

I find it easy to figure out, have gotten compliments from my NP about it, and find it pretty thorough. Love being able to email reports to doctors. 
I have some suggestions also. 
1. When previous entries are offered as a choice, it would be easier if the blank entry box showed up at the top instead of at the bottom.
2. It would be helpful if a list of family were available to choose from for filling out Family History--often they will be the same for everybody. This would mean needing a way to identify the relative by a name and being able to change the relationship (i.e. my husband's sister is also my children's paternal aunt).

3. I am hoping that someday you will add features like charts that will show things like blood pressure over time, or separate apps that could track the info but allow the results to be integrated into the main app for reports, etc.

My Medical seemed the best… comprehensive; good reviews with respect to its stability; appealing interface; ease of use and so on.

It became obvious within less than five minutes that such other reviews were accurate.

The system of being able to copy and paste text etc into a form on the developer's website (which then emails My Medical owners a link via an iPhone mail account - click it and data is entered faultlessly into the App) was particularly appealing.

Further, the App really does allow you to commit a usefully rich range of medical data - and for multiple users, family members, those one cares for etc.

I have a few suggestions:
1.  Many doctors have several location, but you can only add one address.  I have more than one doctor that practices at multiple locations.
2.  Several of the doctors have more than one phone number. I just recently had problems getting in touch with a doctor only to find out that their phone was out of order.  I called the hospital and got another number.  When the phone was repaired, then I went back to using the original number.  But, the other number is still good.  Although this was a minor incident, I think it's a good idea.  Plus, what about cell numbers?
3.  The practice's name would be helpful.

It has made it much easier for me to keep track of my mom's medications and allergies. It would be perfect though if the following improvements were made:

1. When printing or making a pdf, it would be nice to choose which categories I wanted included. Sometimes I just want medications and allergies and nothing else, but it prints out everything which ends up being pages to sift through. 

2. Also, when printing or making a pdf, I wish it would organize the info into a spreadsheet. This makes it much easier for a doctor to review. 

3. Finally, I wish there was an online cloud version (like evernote or ireminder) so that my mom could add info from her computer and have it show up on my computer.

Email and txt views are also an added plus for sending to providers, and who could complain about the email backup option?  I've had the app for a few hours now and have finally finished filling everything in.  The photo ID for each patient prevents emergency workers from applying the wrong patient info to the wrong person, which is another plus.  Additionally, I'm glad the info isn't stored on servers anywhere (preserving strict privacy) and doesn't require wi-fi to access. 

A very minor bug I found:

- When ""view information as text"" or ""send info by email"" options are selected, emergency contacts' phone number is shown as ""PrimaryTelForNumber"" rather than the actual number. I would correct to show actual telephone numbers.

I purchased two; one for my mac, one for my iPhone, 
with the  simple idea that they would communicate with each other.
 
i needed to go see my cardiologist this Monday morning armed with the proper information. 
I spent weeks and weeks collecting all my health data I needed to have prepared for him. 
I had an issue with the syncing; I'm using dropbox but the units weren't speak to each other.
I wrote to support asking for some advice on how to get the two apps to communicate; no response,
wait a couple days, ask again, nothing.

it's been 10 days now, and all i receive from them is the ""acknowledgment of your email"" response.

for those of you who are syncing properly, it appears to be a useful app,

I would also like to graph my weight and blood pressure readings and be able to send them to my doctor. I have to use two other apps to do this. Would be nice if one app would handle all of this.

My Medical,347860026,3.5,679,AMAZING Lifesaver,SFC @rcher,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id40243333,1,1,4,"I have used this app since its release because of my health issues.  I am a disabled veteran and have many health issues that would be a nightmare to track if not for this app.  I am able to schedule all of my Dr. Appts, Lab Appts and keep track of everything.  I also have to track 11 prescriptions plus those that I have been removed from and thanks to this app, I just email a list to the Dr. before each appt.  I am also able to keep all of my blood work and keep track of improvements and failures on the heart disease side of life.

One of the other great aspects to this app is that it is very easy to enter data and then back it up straight to my own email.  My info stays with me and is not stored with someone else in the world...THANKS GUYS!!!  Once backed up in multiple places/ways...it is easliy recoverable and puts me right back to where I was.  Customer Service is OUTSTANDING...a reply to any email happens in less then 2 hours based on my multiple questions/issues over the years.  I have ALWAYS had my question or issue resolved usually within the same day!

Lastly I would recommend two things...Change the App Icon...it is ugly and does not draw attention to medical personnel that there is important info available in a medical emergency.  The current icon makes it look like a ""To Do"" / ""Task"" List and not a medical information app.  I would also recommend that if a person where in a medical emergency situation that they could open the app, hit a button that would dial 911 and provide a gps location to the dispatcher.  In this way, the app would be open and if the patient became unconsious then rescue would be on the way and the app would already be open when they arrived.

Otherwise, I HIGHLY recommend this app and will change my 4 stars to 5 when/if my recommendations are added.  Great App Guys!!!",2012-03-21T15:34:44-07:00

My Medical,347860026,3.5,679,Good for Meds,JA.Macko,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id42280346,1,1,2,"Keeping track of all your medical information as you get older is tedious and hard work.  If you enjoy that hard work, this app can help you, as it will lose your information on a regular basis, and you will have to re-enter it over and over.  Customer Service has informed me that this doesn't happen, it must be something I am doing wrong. Maybe.

If you have family members you can add their info as well, by making multiple profiles.   You can email yourself a back up.  You can also email a copy of the date you have enter so you can print it out for your doctor, which is very handy.    

A new feature in this version is iCloud; There is basically no help on this, the help is basic and only  shows you how to turn it on, it has no troubleshooting on how to get it to sync, when it will not sync; and customer service will not help unless you can pin point your question on how it's not working or not sync'n.  My Medical has a web site you can visit, has forms and a help page.

Entering medical information on the My Medical app can be done with your computer,  but can not be edited on your computer.  (so you will need to start over each time)

Lab Tests & Procedures-This feature is particularly un-helpful.  I have not found any doctor office that transfers this info like x-rays or labs.  You must have them and enter them yourself.   So If you do not save copies of medical info from various doctors, you will  not have the info to put in My Medical app.  

I give this app 2 stars only because I can easily find the medicines I take, and it helps me remember them at the doctors office when I'm filling out forms.",2012-07-03T16:09:49-07:00
My Medical,347860026,3.5,679,"Good, but could be much better",TexJoeB,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id48867153,0,0,2,"Hope the developers read this. 

I have been looking like an app like this for a while, and although I was hesitant to purchase an app I couldn't try for free first I went ahead and purchased it.

The good it does what it says. What could be better?

Here's my suggestions:
Medications - many apps will let you pick from a list, which includes interactions, side effects, pill identification marks & even pictures. With this app you have to type in all the info yourself, no additional drug info, and you have to find & save (or take a picture of the pill) and add it yourself.

Vaccinations:
Everytime you add a vaccination the app adds a block. It would be better to have one block per vaccination, that shows the latest record & when you click on the box it opens to records for that vaccine, ie 1 box for polio, not 5.

Tests: would like to be able to add individual portions of tests & select which ones to compare ie WBC, without having to uncheck all the filters, only way to currently do this is enter it separately. This would also help when a dr only runs a portion of the test. For example glucose is included in CMP, but when dr only ran glucose, if i only entered it as glucose, it won't show up in the chart.

Switch to number pad option for entering blood work test results, also no need to open in a new window, just makes entering data slower.

Don't need to be able to see all results when I open window, CBC boxes are long and takes a while to scroll through info. Try accordion style.

Also, there is no way to put in a reference range in on blood work, which would be helpful.

A few final suggestions: add ER visits, not the same as hospitalizations; add selection tool for surgeries, why do I need a box to type in tonsillectomy; lab tests & imaging should be separated, also add facility location option for labs and imaging, blood work ran in ER may be ran by a different lab than a doctors office & X-rays & scans may be done by someone outside your PCP.

That's all for now, I will re-evaluate as the app is updated.",2012-05-05T18:02:35-07:00

Two things to help improve. 
1. Could you add a Pharmacy section? I have two different RX’ so would like to add that info in. 
2. It would be nice to have a customized button in each section to have a field heading I can add to section without using notes all the time. It really can use something like that. Sometimes notes isn’t a good place to put that info. 

Besides my suggestions. I use this app all the time. I highly recommend it! I’ve been using it for two years and the missing pharmacy section is my only complaint.The other is a suggestion. It’s  been a useful app and I refer to it several times a week. Very helpful app!  Highly recommend it!

My Medical,347860026,3.5,679,Wow.  Excellent app.,bluetoucan,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id79002707,1,1,5,"This is quite an app.  Very much worth the $3.  I'm impressed to see that most of the suggestions in older reviews have already been implemented in the app.  For the people who couldn't get password protection to switch on: I had to restart my phone, but then it worked fine from then on. 

I have one suggestion for now.  The app is mostly great with merging in new data you enter using the website, but there is a problem with resolving conflicts.  If you happened to slightly change an entry both on your phone and in the web interface, the app doesn't let you know, or prompt you to resolve the conflict, it just creates two records that are slightly different.  It can get extremely annoying trying to pick out the correct details manually from multiple records.  Small issue in an otherwise fantastic and clearly well-supported app.",2011-03-24T03:42:05-07:00

The other half have things being pulled forward with vague info like medical appointment on such and such date at such and such time, with the main address for the facility, but no provider name to give me any clue as to who I am supposed to see or if I am supposed to be at the main location or a satellite office.  I have looked to the developers website to report these issues but find NO place to reach customer support unless you are a business affiliate.  Really poor customer service standard.  Things didn’t always work like this because I can remember specifically reporting portal issues to them in the past and receiving excellent customer service and attention to help address and correct those issues at that time within hours at that time.

As an EMR Professional I am scared for any providers office that uses this technology.   It DOES NOT meet Meaningful Use and the government needs to be made aware.

How anyone could write a great review WITHOUT submitting their name is ridiculous. All the positive reviews have to have been made by employees.

Iâ€™ve tried multiple stations only a few miles apart and can gain as much as 10 pounds in less than 5 minutes, and the BP cuff can be almost as erratic. Go to your doctors office and get your bp and weight. Go directly to a higi station and you will see what I mean.

Had a monthly challenge and a website where you could get a small coupon or donate your 'watts' (basically points earned for 'steps' you've done)to one of two charities. Simple and easy!! NOW, I wouldn't recommend this app to my worst enemy!! Omg, mostly 'spam' when opens up as it goes on about the new communities they want to expand on, talks about the two they have, asks trivia, asks how you doing, blah, blah, blah. The challenge is still there, only they now also do extra ones for each community so who knows if anyone is actually in the community for what the community is there for or just for the chance at a gift card. This makes these communities almost worthless to connect to others in the same situation as you, which may be why you joined. The metrics are now last, and they will even ask 'what do you use the app for' if you email them about this horrible update!! Even if this is free, just NO! My recommendation is keep eye out for the stations & use them plus a small notebook to keep track of your own blood pressure & weight. If you can't find one then, and only then, download app to find a station. Just be aware that it's up to you to notice if the station is working correctly on top of everything else.

PS. One other suggested change, when you are finishing at the machine, the results pop up after ONE SECOND and says something about it ending right away.

The insights from the higi station have helped me understand my body better and improve my lifestyle all along my 45Lb weight loss journey. As a daily user, I wish a few things were different about my experience: 

1. I do not feel comfortable entering my login information in a public place. I could previously scan a QR code and only had to log in on my phone. 

2. I do not feel comfortable entering my date of birth in public. Is Age not a sufficient input? 

3. I wish the phone app would atleast remember my user name if security is a concern. Frankly security isn't a concern for me since my phone needs a pass code. Almost everybody used a pass code these days! I wish it atleast had an option to ""remember my password"".

4. I wish the Higi app would share data with the IOS health app. It's a widely compatible health tracking platform that has become wildly popular for the same reason. My fitbit app works that way. This makes it so much more convenient to see all my data in one place. Will it reduce my time spent on the Higi app? Yes it will. If the intention is to build a future channel to monetize on ads, I don't really read the articles on the app since they aren't really focused on my goals- maybe another improvement opportunity. 

After thrashing the hard workers on the Higi team with my last comment, here's some food for thought to lighten up the mood- what if Higi worked with insurance companies to collect lab test results and bring it to my phone's health app? Now, that's something insurance companies would pay for. A lot of insurance plans offer free Fitbits to keep people health and thus reduce their risks. I feel Higi can step into the league if they make their case well.

My health achievements are one of many out there, ready to be cited. 

Keep up the great job, don't disappoint. Your users are watching you!",2016-06-15T17:34:45-07:00

I love the convenience of an email, but having an app seemed ideal. I'd consider using this one more often than the other simply because of the associated app on my iPhone 6. 

The app design looks decent, the interface is intuitive. However, every time I try to check my metrics it crashes. I tried closing the app out and started again, no success. Hoping for an easy fix... I'll try again another time. Thanks.",2015-09-14T13:25:16-07:00

I met my goals easily and as soon as they were met and I spent money at doctors or pharmacy I got reimbursed!  This year has been a NIGHTMARE!  This app is irrelevant to my life!  I donâ€™t drink or smoke yet two of the questions I must answer every day are about drinking and smoking-as if at any given moment Iâ€™m just going to decide to start picking up those two bad habits!  REALLY!!!  If I tell you in the beginning that I do NEITHER of those then they should be eliminated from my list of items to check off of my daily wellness routine!  Also...  I completed my Real age test in February and Iâ€™m still getting emails telling me that I only have so many more days to complete it before the end of the plan year!  My real age is plastered on my screen every time I open up the app on my iPhone - so why am I being told I still need to do it again?  Why did it take six phone calls to get your system to finally linked up properly so that I could start getting reimbursed for money spent?

1. I am 36 years old not 76.  I donâ€™t take my BP everyday. I donâ€™t check my glucose everyday.  I didnâ€™t check my cholesterol everyday. I do those things once a year unless otherwise directed by a physician. The app actually showed my â€œrealâ€� age as 34 so why do I need to do these things for the app everyday?
2. Why doesnâ€™t it give you the option of syncing to another device than your phone? I keep my Fitbit with me more than my phone. I have tiny pockets and canâ€™t fit my phone in my pocket while working because of that. I do however keep my Fitbit in my pocket. 
3. If this is really supposed to track health why isnâ€™t there a female reproductive tracking system in place? Lots of women suffer from early signs of reproductive issues that worsen because they donâ€™t see the overall progress of the issues due to improper tracking.
Anyways Iâ€™m deleting because I already have a similar app thatâ€™s better. Hopefully one day my company will cut some type of deal with Fitbit and Iâ€™ll just be able to use the app I like.",2018-07-14T09:47:56-07:00

However, I would really like to see TouchID functionality.  Anthem can do it; why can't Aetna?  Perhaps it could be available in the app settings, but in another bizzare and troubling first for an app, I don't see a ""Settings"" menu anywhere within the app.  I'm not a developer, but I'm kind of surprised that an app can even get App Store approval without a settings menu within the app itself (I realize I can go to ""settings"" within the general ""Settings"" app, but it's just a bare-bones menu that allows you to decide whether to allow the app to use data, and that's it).  In addition, load times for other menus are slower than they have any right to be.

This app continues to demonstrate that Aetna's indifference and contempt for its members by allowing such an underdeveloped app to represent it.  Use it if you absolutely must, but the native website on iOS may be a better alternative.",2017-01-02T12:09:28-07:00

I can also pull up my insurance card; which is good since I never carry it with me. 

The app does look terrible on the iPhone 6s Plus and iPad - I think it looks bad across iOS 9 in general. It would also be nice if Aetna allowed the app to work with the finger print scanner and/or 1Password - having to login every time with the password is a bit annoying; but it's better than allowing the app to remember the password and give anyone who uses your device access.

I discovered that the web site was having the same problem at some of those times.

I see others have complained that the claims function says they have no claims.
When you go to that function, there are two tabs on the page.
The left one is supposed to be a claims list.
Trial and error indicates it apparently defaults to listing claims that are no more than 30 days old

So, it really just means you don't have any claims 30 days or less old.
THEY SHOULD SAY THAT!

If you use the ""Claim Search"" tab, you can select a longer period of time

How can you develop an app these days and not provide the option to paste your password???

What would really be nice is the ability to self report health data like weight, BP, blood sugar levels, cholesterol levels and so on.  Iâ€™m trying to lose weight so I periodically weigh myself. Instead of some other app why canâ€™t I keep that data here?  I go to the Stanford blood bank and they compute my cholesterol level and take my BP.  Why canâ€™t I keep that data here?

The data I enter could be tagged as â€œself reportedâ€� so a medical provider would know if the data was my measurement or if it was taken by a professional. 

Providing this capability could be a plus in a patientâ€™s health care.  Imagine an overweight patient with a blood sugar and cholesterol problem. Instead of only having data points from when they see a Kaiser professional (primary physician, physicianâ€™s assistant, nurse, dietician, etc) the health provider has as much data as possible.  This could help reveal trends in health related behavior and thus better allow the provider to tailor treatment. 

Mobile computing could take health care to another level but health care providers like Kaiser are only scratching the surface.  Hopefully someone at Kaiser will see these comments and will consider the enhancements I have suggested above.",2017-11-25T04:32:44-07:00

Kaiser Permanente,493390354,3.0,1779,Reschedule function horrible,Npcgurl,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id263486507,0,0,1,"I used to love this app.  I am highly irritated I rescheduled an appt.   apparently I did not hit the final confirm button.  So why would they delete the original appt if I never confirmed the new appt?  So I show up to my appointment and nothing shows up.  This is horrible from a user experience , It should show me or tell me that nothing was booked or removed.  I took time off work and pulled my son out of school .   The nurse looked at the appointment and she said it looked like three appointments were booked at the same time and cancelled at the same time .  Definitely a defect with your reschedule function that should be looked at and fixed.  
I noticed that I am now able to reschedule a minor injury appt online which was never available and this is what type of appt it was for. Perhaps the issue is with the logic that has to do with non standard office visits ?",2018-09-25T10:31:28-07:00

My only issue so far is that it doesnâ€™t specifically show me where to go for an appointment...

For example, I have an appointment at 6:30am at the Fontana location in Radiology to get scanned. I can see on the appointment page the location with regards to the hospitalâ€™s address, but the hospital is divided into 4 buildings, 1,2,3 and their overnight building. Plus the outlying speciality buildings. There happen to be 4 Radiology units here. So if I have an appointment in building 3 on the basement level in Radiology, but show up to the 3rd floor Radiology unit in building 2 it might make me very late. I have good mobility, imagine if someone with poor mobility faced the same issue.

My suggestion, add the specific building and maybe the floor needed for checking in to the â€œlocationâ€� portion of the appointment page.",2018-08-22T06:53:47-07:00

-Member ID #
-See a list of medications I've taken in the past, what I am currently taking, the dosages, and dates.
-Refill prescriptions and have them sent to my home
-Set up appointments
-See test results as soon as they're available

Improvements I would like to see:
-Have an offline mode with stored info so that I can view it if I'm on the phone

It could be so convenient, if it were accurate and worked. There have been numerous times when it says my prescriptions are available for refill (meaning it's not on the list that says it's too early for a refill and won't allow you to even try) that I've requested a refill, and not only has my physician authorized the refill and the pharmacy I'm to pick it up at notified me it was ready for pick up, and I've taken the bus (I can't drive due to medical condition) all the way to the pharmacy only to get there and find out ""oh sorry it's too early to refill that prescription"". I get it, with the prescription drug abuse epidemic you have to be careful and strict and I'm fine with following any and all rules regarding that. But you need to link your website and app with your pharmacy rules so that people aren't told via the app it's okay to request a refill and their doctor okay that refill and the pharmacy tells you come pick it up, then you waste your time because when you do, oops sorry too soon. That's so ridiculous. And honestly 3 days before a medication you take daily is due to run out is when patients can request a refill? 3 days? It takes 3 days or longer just to get your doctors approval most times and then another 2 for it to be filled. I've run out of medications I take daily too many times because of this ""rule"" and I say ""rule"" because you never know if the pharmacist who is working follows that rule or not. Some do, some will fill a three month prescription a month early or a one month prescription 10 days early. At least be consistent so patients aren't suddenly told of a rule that supposedly isn't new but in the 13 years I've had kaiser insurance has never been enforced until recently. When I ask if it's new, nope, always been the rule. Huh, then you've got a whole lot of staff who don't follow your rules and that's an issue. The ""past visit"" info is a joke (it literally tells you nothing other than the date of your past visit) and the ""medical history"" is also a joke since it tells you any chronic illnesses you have (great thanks didn't know that already) and what medications you take (and never updates so apparently I've been on antibiotics for years now). 99% of appts you'd make you have to call to make anyways so the appt part is mostly useless as well. So all in all if you want to know where a Kaiser facility is located or need to email your doctor (which is the only reason I gave a star, this feature is useful, as long as your doctor actually checks and responds which 2 of mine do amazingly, and one takes several months to hear back if I do, but not the apps fault) then this app might work for you. Otherwise it's just a huge waste of space.",2018-08-14T01:24:29-07:00

I could refill prescriptions, see all my test results, send/receive emails, and make appointments. Then recently all of my prescriptions showed there were no refills and that still hasn't changed. If I try to use the RX number it won't go through either. I have now started to just go into the pharmacy, request my refill and wait. :-( I spoke to the pharmacy and they told me their system changed and they realize it doesn't speak to the phone app. That was around the start of 2016 that I heard that. Now we are at mid 2016.... Is a fix in sight?

I thought that was the only problem, but now I am having problems with test results. I can see every test done in 2015 and older. I just had a bunch of 2016 bloodwork done and it showed up at first, but then I realized that after I looked at my results the tests disappeared. The 2016 data just seems to be gone. Even when I view an old test that shows a history of all other results it only goes to 2015. This was a disappointment. Hopefully the appointment and email features continue to work. I keep looking for a new app. Please fix this!!",2016-06-28T06:02:12-07:00
Kaiser Permanente,493390354,3.0,1779,Pretty good for a healthcare provider,Reynard Sheerr,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id40613739,0,1,4,"Sadly, I am no longer a Kaiser member due to a change in employers (I love Kaiser). Overall, the app is pretty good but not great. It provides access to your future and past appointments with after visit summaries, lab results, immunization records, messages from your doctor, an electronic representation of the membership card and much more.

Some of the functionality just seems to be a web page embedded inside the app, some features look native.

What would make the app delightful, and 5 star worthy, are the seemingly small details and features. Below is my feature wishlist. I know, it's not always easy to make this sort of stuff happen, especially in the healthcare environment where HIPAA compliance and the bureaucracy that comes with it can slow down the easiest tasks. 

1. The app doesn't particularly look great on large screen iPhones.
2. While the electronic membership card is embedded inside the app, it would be even better if Kaiser provided an Apple Wallet membership card.
3. HealthKit integration: I wanted to import my medical record into the Health app. Unfortunately, the app doesn't provide an easy way to do so. I tried to import the health summary XML file that Kaiser provides on its website. Sadly, the Health app was unable to read it.  I have successfully imported HL7 XML files from other providers, so I know it works.
4. Move more of the interface from webviews into native views.",2016-10-02T16:34:35-07:00

In order to schedule an appointment with that primary care provider, the application asks if the user would like to schedule a ""non-physical appointment within two days"" or a ""non-physical appointment in the future."" As if those two options aren't both in the future, it then prompts for a date range regardless of which option the user chooses. This actually happens twice for the ""in the future"" option. Why ask the user if they'd like an appointment within two days then ask for a date range again? The final step is the most aggravating. If the user's specified date range doesn't return an available appointment slot, they have to completely start over. Why don't you suggest a date or time, or show the available dates in the first place? Scheduling has been this way since I downloaded the app about a year ago.

It's very good for communicating with my doctors (given the HIPAA limitations on using regular email for that purpose) but it has a lot of problems in other areas (e.g., I can't use the appointment app to set an appointment with my oncologist who's been treating me for 5 years, only with my primary).  I have a sense that the app was released without any end user usability testing. 

My previous comments are still not addressed or even acknowledged: Newest release still shows ""no new"" messages/test results on opening menu screen when there are new of either type. Overall the app is a 3-4 but misleading and could cause patient to miss important information.  (Even if the programmers seem not to care, I would think the KP lawyers or the Office for Civil Rights might.)

I am reiterating my original complaint. They will let you choose the pharmacy. They give you a select button with which to select what pharmacy you would like to pick up your prescription at. Then there is no next button. There is no logical way to get onto the next page. There are only three buttons available, none of them The next button, nor any other button to get it onto the next page. The only three buttons available to you after the select your pharmacy to pick up your prescription page is: ""back"", ""cancel"" (I assume that the ""cancel"" Button is essentially the same as the back button in terms of results), and then there is the ""search"" button, with which to search and select the pharmacy from.

I can't scroll down my emails, the status bar that shows the time and battery life does not disappear, when setting an appt, it will show the location I need to go to but disappears after and I can't search for it any longer, not even in the appt status which will only show the general location.

1. Probably the first reason most people want the app is to make a doctors appt. But there's nowhere on the Dashboard to do that! For two years I thought the app didn't allow you to make an appt. I just discovered that there IS a way, it's just not listed on the Homepage Dashboard! You have to go searching thru about 3-4 steps to even find where to begin. Then, it doesn't really work...
2. When you finally get into ""make an appt,"" you can choose either ""make an appt within two days"" (with whatever dr. is available, I assume). It even tells you the two dates you have to choose from: today or tomorrow. But when you try to do that, there is no way to make it with anyone other than your PC dr; then it says, ""no appts available on those dates."" Right! That's why I am willing to see any dr- so I can get in, in less than three weeks (the wait for my PC). 
So bottom line-- there IS no way to make a short-term appt within the next two days. Which leaves you with two choices: (a) wait three weeks to see your PC, or (b) go to ER.

There's gotta be a better system, Kaiser! Seriously, sit down with an average client and have them try to negotiate this app!

Also, too many steps to use options.  Users should not have to go thru so many steps for simple things like messages, prescription renewal or looking at lab results (pc version too).

No, you have to scroll way down, past your own text, past the precious emails from your doctor, and at the very bottom you can click ""send"", after which you are sent to a page that doesn't clearly tell you if the email was sent, or if you can view your sent email.

Update: they have resolved the password issue as of the latest version of the app.  There are still a couple annoyances in the app now that I am logged in:

1. The addresses for facilities on my iPhone 5 don't fit in the box within the app meant to contain them and are sometimes unreadable. 

2. The regex for validating email addresses when submitting prescriptions isn't the same as the main site.  I like to use gmail's '+' operator within my email address for filtering. The main site account settings allow for this character but the prescription part states the email is invalid. As I have to change this every time I refill a prescription this gets annoying.

For example knowing where all the lab/diagnostic offices were by default along with adult pt was really unnecessary. I think having a one click emergency/after care button based on location would be a great add. After several tries we figured out how it worked. In a concerned moment having to guess around for a location was not ideal.

Another plus with the app and the kaiser site in general would be the ability to manage your children's info under our own login. Right now this is not possible.

My favorite part is that it makes it so easy to review recent claims: I can choose parameters for what I want to review. For example, I can choose to review only medical claims for me in the last 30 days. Or I can review only dental claims for my daughter within the last 90 days. I can further specify only paid claims, or those that were denied, being processed, being appealed, or have been adjusted, etc. I also love that I can ""Live Chat"" if I have a question. 
Three suggestions for improvement: 
1. Make ""Live Chat"" available 24/7 (or see #2)
2. Allow me to send a message/ask a question to be answered by customer service via return message the next day. 
3. Allow me to see status of requests for pre-certification/preauthorization. For example, after my doctor submits a request, I'd like to be able to see if it was received, if it's under review, whether or not the request was approved or denied, and the reason for that decision. 
Thank you Cigna!",2017-10-09T01:31:37-07:00

Pretty seamless but gets caught up in itself once every so often and trips up. My biggest reason for giving this app 4 stars (& writing this review) is because the In/Out-of-Network doctors is not current & hasn't been for months and months, if not years. Multiple times I've called doctors offices to get an appt only to be told that doctor hasn't worked there for a while or no answer at all.

I maybe wrong but you are making difficult to use strong passwords and make it frustratingly easy to just give up and use the easy passwords used for the accounts that does not really have personal information and with no security exposure because you can return to app later and not consistently having to reset your password.

myCigna,569266174,4.5,32819,Insurance made Easier,Tourchwood,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id32258067,0,0,5,"""My Cigna"" by a standard PC was convenient and easier, but with this app, being on top of your plan from every aspect has been made even more easier!  I love it.  

I can keep track of all my medical care, cost (if any), doctor's names and telephone numbers, and benefits. At a touch of my phone or iPad I have access to my questions, incentives rewards, and much more.  If for some reason my question has no answers here, I have telephone numbers that hook me up with the right specialist who can help answer my questions. Do you seek advice from their RNs on call?  It's there in the app. Phone numbers to assist you. Are you on vacation and need to go to Urgent Care or a doctor?  The app assist you with that too. Can't remember you doctor's phone number, or the spelling of their name?  Good news, it's all stored in the app to make life and those times of illness or accidents a bit easier so you can focus on getting better.

There is even a simple consent page with gives you and your spouse reciprocal access to the other's information.  For me that alone is invaluable.

myCigna,569266174,4.5,32819,Too many mistakes to depend on as a usable app,Marietta Dave,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id230356373,2,2,2,"The only part of this app that I found to be usable, is a listing and address book of pharmacies in my area.

Using the ""price a drug"" area has been very misleading, and is often dead wrong. This specific area will commonly tell you that you can fill a 90 day order at a local pharmacy; this is almost never correct.

The drug mail order status area has too little detail.  For instance, a drug may be ""in process"" for many days. A phone call is required to find out what the problem is, completely negating the ease of use of this app. 

Also, the mail order status area will often list tracking numbers. I have found that some tracking numbers have no status for more than a week. I can only assume that a specific prescription was set to ship out on a certain date, but for some unknown reason is not sent.

I have also sent in prescriptions to be filled, only to find out a few weeks later that I had to call in and ""release the order"" for no reason whatsoever that could be explained to me.

These are just a few of the few dozen problems I have run into trying to use this app. I am very glad their customer service number is 7/24.",2017-04-27T16:55:36-07:00

I, too, had the issue with my password not working, but I reset it and it works fine now. There's a feature I haven't checked out fully yet, but seems very helpful -- Health Wallet. This feature allows you to store specific health info for each person on your plan. 

The ONLY inconvenience I've run across so far is this... When there are multiple charges on one claim, the app shows the discount for each charge, but does not add them up in the end. I either have to pull it up on the computer for that total charge or pull out my calculator and figure it out myself.",2014-10-03T04:52:50-07:00

Almost a year later (v.i.) in formal written (forget useless phone calls) appeals, grievances, state insurance commission complaints, appeal to U.S. Senator for help, complaint with CMS (the official Medicare â€œcustodianâ€� and ombudsman), my case has yet to be resolved. CIGNA HEALTHSPRINGSRX owes me thousands in DIRECT MEMBER REIMBURSEMENT for out of pocket expenses.  I hold approvals for reimbursement â€” basically promissory notes â€” but the battle rages.  Next is a court battle.  

 I suppose negative stars are verboten... The CIGNA app won't let me sign in. Customer support by phone gives friendly reps, a ""ticket"" #, NO action. For weeks, appealed denials change the reasons for denial -- prior authorization required or NOT, drug not on formulary when clearly shown on website.  Appeals continue.

The Pros:
-The app keeps me up to date on  my Copay and deductible limits for me and the family. 
-Cigna covers my LTD claim as well, and with this app I have access to all of my coverage through Cigna. 
-everything I want to know is easily accessible, I can find doctors who are in network, and more importantly those that aren't. I can also see when a check has been cut for my LTD, no need to go to multiple sites.
-It helps me to keep Cigna on their toes in regards to mistakes made by them or my providers rather than being notified months later with a bill. 
Cons:
-Updates take longer to post.
-It has a tendency to freeze up or not allow you to sign in which generally happens after changes have been made and you have to contact mobile support to fix the glitch.

Overall I think the app is a great tool, much easier than the full site and I use it several times a week.",2017-03-21T22:12:15-07:00

Surprising amount of physician and medical procedure information is available to the user once one learns where to find it in the application. 

Because the app requires users to log in with their unique name and password, one would expect to be able to see ""coverage specific information"" to their plan, unfortunately that is not the case; only the more general coverage summaries are available.

Unreliable:
The app is clearly maintained by developers with little experience in large database/mobile app integration. 

When the application does connect it can be very slow, very sloooow. Sometimes inbox will have a message that a section of the app may not be accessible at that time - probably due to upgrades and API development - to be expected given the infrastructure size and various databases being integrated - it's going to be a long haul to get this all working.

Love that there are so very many sorting options (now that our spending options have popped up again), since sorting by open claims is far easier than skimming through still-processing older claims. It's also a blessing to be able to jump to EOBs on the run - especially at a hospital or doc's office.

Blue Shield has been unresponsive to my emails regarding this or any other issues. Diagnosis: Coma. 

Addendum: A day after I wrote the above review I discovered that the app won't let me in! Blue Shield must have taken it off life support. Called death of Mr. App at 7:44 am.

A day later while resting in the morgue Mr. App came back to life! It's a miracle! Can now view ID card, view plan summary, view claims, find urgent care and find a provider, but alas he still won't let me pay my monthly premium or transfer to the full site. Maybe in his next reincarnation he will be endowed with these features.

And then behold in the following weeks a transformation of unbelievable dimensions occurred. It was possible to transfer to the main site and pay my premium!

Your app is solid overall but lacks some key features. Here is some feedback for features I think customers would benefit from:

- Ability to mark claims as Paid, Unpaid. Would also be nice to have a notes section that customers can flag certain bills to set up a personal payment plan with their budgets.
- Filters for the above suggestion i.e. filtering paid, unpaid, you may owe, flagged, noted, last 30/60 days, last 6 months, current year, previous year
- Prescriptions section that lists any drug prescriptions given to patient by care giver. When the prescription was filled, etc.
-The ability to add/view accounts associated with medical bills like HSA, DCFSA, OptiMed accounts, etc.
- Pay in app feature with above suggested accounts through something like Instamed or other comparable companies.
- Integration with smart devices (FitBit, Apple Watch, etc). I envision a simple step tracker that ties to ""feel good"" push notifications and maybe paired with some Humana promotions/rewards.
-Ability to show customers which care providers are in-network vs. out-of-network when using the ""Find Care"" tab. If all are in-network, there should be a message present stating this for better understanding.

Thanks for the current features, looking forward to continued updates and new features to be added for a better customer experience!

First of all, its website: It is hard to figure out how to file a claim from the web after breezy steps of setting up an account. It almost feels like Humana is discouraging you from making claims. Then,  there is not a single phone number you could call and ask on the web until I found the claim form for Express Maternity. Now, this app: I downloaded this app because I was so impressed with other apps related to my maternity leave. However, what a disappointment. At least Humana web site said I do not have a claim history. But the app said I no longer have an insurance with Humana. What???? I deleted this embarrassing app immediately.

I use 1Password to manage all logins & credentials. This permits me to use unique, generated, complex passwords for each site and app. This also means that I need to copy and paste my password from 1Password into MyHumana. 

Since your app doesn't permit that, I have two choices: don't use the app, or choose a weak, easily memorable password. Guess which one I choose.

Would help that you expose all information, including the drug name on all communications .
Your password protection should include a reset feature, that is in the original communication, that allows the customer, to request a reset be sent to his email address so he can create a current pass word.
My sense is you are not understanding your customer base and should interview 8 or 10. 65+ year old customers.  
Think retail and what this 65+ year old customer receives at his local CVS or Walgreens .    Get competitive from a customer service perspective .
  Bet you will get more Biz.
To even send this message you require a nickname. I’ve tried 6so far and they are all taken.   This is perceived as a knot hole to inhibit feedback.   Not good

Anthem Anywhere,589443627,2.0,1475,Touch ID issue,MGI3,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id37456268,3,4,4,"First of all, I really like this mobile App.    Simple, super fast find what I need. It’s like as soon as I login I can instantly find my ID card via the “View ID Card” quick link. And same way to quickly find my payment info or make payment,etc.   I would give 5 star but with the issue below I found, which to me is an important feature needed. 

I wanted to use touch ID to log in.  So I went to MENU/Profile/Login and Security to enable the Touch ID feature.  To test that, I logged out of the App first, right away I got prompted with either using Touch ID to log back in or clicking Cancel to cancel the Touch ID feature and use regular login  by manually entering password.  If I choose the Touch ID and I got no problem log back in which is good.  However if I’m done and want to completely log off, the only choice is to click Cancel, which seems to be designed to cancel the Touch ID feature.   The problem with that is if I want to login again,  I’ll have to use the regular log, i.e. manually enter my password.

When I got to the App Store to download it I was worried it wouldn’t be worth it bc of all the 1 star reviews complaining about not being able to view the electronic copy of the ID card. So after deciding to check out the app for myself to see, I found out that there is absolutely no issue with the app and I pulled up the ID card in seconds. By simply selecting “Menu” -> “My Coverage” -> “ID Card” an image of the ID card will pop up with a front and back. I hope this helps bc I know how stressful it is to not have a copy of the card!",2018-01-26T09:57:20-07:00

Add to that I had my tongue surgically removed from Cancer and can barely speak at all !  Then if you try to email them through the app the subject drop down menu won't work so you CANNOT even send an email question !   Bill paying feature was ok for a couple months but last week it said $79 under Pay Bill. I checked again a few days later and now it says NO BILL DUE ?   I never made a payment so why did it change suddenly ?   Do I owe $79 or not ???   Of course I can't get in contact to ASK THEM because the email portion of the app doesn't work !    This is what happens when you have a monopoly situation.  They don't care because they don't have to !

Now, cannot access account with new PW after it worked for about a week--the temp PW is being used again!!!  I changed my PW again, will see what happens, but now no ID card access, coverage/deductible access, and no prescription tab.  Security issues??? Pretty lame for such a large BCBS entity.
Update 3/3/16:  This app is getting more and more unusable each week.  While checking claims, the providers names are scrambled as they are shown on screen, as compared to website where names are properly shown.  Still cannot access deductible and coverage info, so far only card info available.  Tech support still has a temp PW to login as they are ""investigating"" issue.

This version is leaps, bounds, and light years ahead of the previous one!  It allows you to do the basic stuff you SHOULD be able to do on a health insurance app: find doctors, see your ID card, estimate costs of procedures, etc.  However, a full list of procedures and surgeries can be 10's of thousands long, this app only has a several hundred of your most common & 'basic' procedures (and surgeries).  Overall, it's worth downloading just to have in case of emergencies, general info, and the like.

I just started coverage with them, so I was checking to make sure my current provider was listed.  It took a minute to realize that u can't just type in a zip code...you have to wait for it to process and then select the complete city, state and zip for it to work correctly.  Other than that, everything seemed to function correctly and timely. I only rated it a 3 because there isn't a lot to see when you select benefits.

There is no digital ID card and no information on benefits or claims. My personal profile is currently inaccessible, returning an error message and a plea to be patient. When I tried to leave a review in the section asking what they could do better...I got an error message!
The ask ""How can we make the app as healthy as possible?""  My advice? Get a defibrillator; the patient needs to be ALIVE before we even discuss HEALTHY!

That said, considering it doesn't save your searches or login info is pretty painful.  All it does is help you find a doctor and show you images of your health cards.

That would be fine and good IF the information was even up to date.  I spent HOURS trying to find a pediatrician for my son.  If the numbers we called weren't outright disconnected they rarely reached their intended target.  If we even got to the right hospital we'd get random departments like billing let alone the actual doctor we were looking to reach.
