Even worse, itâ€™s not even in the app, itâ€™s emailed to you. And if youâ€™re a novice runner like me, itâ€™s of little use. For example i got an email telling me to to a Fartlek run. No instructions or guidance.   The worst is that Strava has among the worst customer service I have ever experienced. They are slow to respond (like weeks), and when they do they are not helpful. I asked why my plan hadnâ€™t uploaded to my app, and they emailed be back a week later and said it would be emailed to me. I asked when it would be customized as advertised, they never responded.  I finally started receiving the emails 19 days later. When I complained that they were not helpful and I wanted a refund, no one ever emailed me back.   I was complaining to a fellow runner who pointed me to the Nike run club app. It is free, gives you a customized training plan, itâ€™s embedded into your app, and thereâ€™s a coach that tells you how to run it as you are running it.   I think the Strava app is much better for basic stuff, I like their features better than the Nike Run Club.  But for training guides, go Nike. Itâ€™s free, helpful, and their customer support on Twitter is out of this world good. They are incredibly helpful and answer within hours."}, {"title": "Latest update crashes on Apple Watch", "author": "loopder", "authorUrl": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id32026806", "rating": "1", "date": "2018-10-26T13:13:54-07:00", "voteSum": "0", "voteCount": "0", "content": "Version 69.0.0 has completely messed up connectivity with Apple Watch Series 3.

It would be nice to set alert indicators for certain thresholds.  For example, if my heart rate goes over 185bpm, flash an alert.  Or if I pass a certain distance .  Itâ€™s similar to the live segments concept where an alert pops up notifying you of a favorite segment."}, {"title": "Notification voice..", "author": "Pranav.2183", "authorUrl": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id567972710", "rating": "1", "date": "2018-10-25T06:25:09-07:00", "voteSum": "0", "voteCount": "0", "content": "Pls pls.. restore the notification voice with the one u had it earlier.. the new voice is v v v v bad n pathetic... sounds like am dying 1 mile 9 mins.. still qondering how u ppl changed it without listening to it.."}, {"title": "Solid app. More Apple Watch developments needed", "author": "Nashman30", "authorUrl": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id41871593", "rating": "4", "date": "2018-10-25T05:59:35-07:00", "voteSum": "0", "voteCount": "0", "content": "I really like the app. Solid performance.

There is no way to do this in the app.  Itâ€™s beyond frustrating why this has to be the case.  Itâ€™s a small issue but a perfect example of weird choices made with this app    â€¢The layout of different sections and options is poorly designed, often when selecting what looks like should be an edit link for settings it turns out to just be a wall of text describing the feature and linking to the website.  Itâ€™s just not intuitive and hasnâ€™t started making more sense over the three months Iâ€™ve used it    â€¢Iâ€™ve consistently had trouble getting it to recognize my Polar BT HRM, even when it seems to be seeing it.

They're hard to press and a lot of the times, the don't work. A good example is the bell on the Feed.

However, Strava even after turning the autopause feature off does server side autopause no matter what unless you also mark a workout as a race. Why? Turning autopause off should be enough to not give me any autopauses.   Another biggie is adding manual workouts. Too often especially in the winter in sub 30Â° weather my phone dies so I need to go in and add a manual workout afterwards. However, Strava does not support mapped manual workouts. You can only add total distance and time worked out into a manual workout. Why? If I knew my distances without a tracking app I wouldnâ€™t use a tracking app. A simple map tool to add the route I ran and calculating the distance for me seems pretty basic.  I deleted Strava after their most recent update completely bricked the app for iOS 11.2.5 users and itâ€™s been 4 days since that and their has been no new update to fix the issue.

Furthermore, the Apple default activity  app which Iâ€™ve been using for swimming does not automatically share this info with the Strava app and there is no option to do this.  So, Iâ€™m kind of disappointed since I am â€œfriendsâ€� with a few people and they would give me the ğŸ‘� after a swim. Now I have to explain that Iâ€™m using a new watch that doesnâ€™t offer swimming in the Strava app.   I suggest the developers figure out how to incorporate swimming in their iwatch app or at least â€œshareâ€� this info with the Stava app the way Garmin does."}, {"title": "Can be improved", "author": "fr33lance007", "authorUrl": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id41687950", "rating": "3", "date": "2018-05-01T14:20:23-07:00", "voteSum": "0", "voteCount": "0", "content": "Below are the basic features that are missing in order to make Strava THE tool to track your athletics performance: 1) Be able to create splits with the Apple Watch app during the workout.

Only split (for 1km) and average for the whole workout can be seen. This is especially a problem when you do interval workouts like yasso800Â´s, since you donâ€™t know the speed for the 800m you are running. Other apps can easily do it and I donâ€™t get the point why Strava just doesnÂ´t add a third option of current pace besides split and avg.  (ii) There is no way to use your Apple Watch 3 to record a swimming workout and upload it to Strava. The only thing you can do is upload a workout manually, but it wonâ€™t show you the splits not anything. The Apple Watch 3 is the most native device to iPhones and the activity app nicely records the swim data, so it there should either be an option to import that to Strava or do natively record a workout with the watch in Strava.  (iii) it would be nice if there were certain standard interval workouts added, so you can choose the pace you want to run and the distance for each split and the watch will tell you when to speed up/ slow down.

What would be useful is having 3rd party apps able to upload stats from the actual workout.

As a free mileage and route tracker, strava performs as well as any other cycling app with the added semi-benefit of a social media style feed which no one really interacts with in a serious way.   Upgrading to premium offers several benefits, none of which are actually that enticing. The main feature is being able to map your heart rate and caloric burn rate against other variables for each ride.   What made me cancel my subscription is how poor the HR tracking actually is. There are huge flat spots and unexplained cliffs (example: going up a hill and strava says my HR is around 100bpm) on my charts consistently.

Make the most popular features enabled with few features keeping for the premium version. 2. I see the ads of this app at every free app I use. Iâ€™ll suggest you to first listen to your current user base and work on improving the app and spend less money on advertising it.  The app may have great utility(I have not used it yet. So donâ€™t know much). However, if people get annoyed by the ads, Itâ€™s not going to work.  I really wanted to try this app but now I am not going to. As such I am too lazy to write reviews even for the things/services I have used. However, I was so intrigued by the negative user reviews and my interest in the app that I decided to write this review even before using the app. I will download the app if I see positive reviews at my next visit to your app. Until then Sayonara!!"}, {"title": "Forced subscription", "author": "meeeeeoe", "authorUrl": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id576908465", "rating": "1", "date": "2018-08-30T04:46:31-07:00", "voteSum": "0", "voteCount": "0", "content": "The app is free for a month, then you will be charged a subscription.

Thatâ€™s what my one star review was based on previously. Now, after reading some reviews and developer responses, and experiencing it myself first hand, I wish I could make it zero stars. If I click no on a premium membership, that means I donâ€™t want it. I understand ads help you keep it free, but it interrupts almost every setting and page you click on, taking up half the page so you canâ€™t read whatâ€™s underneath it, and if you try to click the â€œxâ€� to close it out it just brings up the sign up page. If your going to do ads, do them periodically, make them small and LET ME CLOSE THEM. And PS developer, I donâ€™t wanna hear how sorry you are and how my feedback will be utilized, just fix it. Donâ€™t tell me, just do it.

Didn't track me by GPS but figured it was something I had done. Day 2 was good. Day 3 was a rest day. Today was day 4 and again, the ad popped up but I didn't notice it until I was at a point I knew it should have told me to cool down. Now it tells me I still have 20 minutes left to finish my walk and I know I walked about 2 1/2 miles. I know that if u purchaser the upgrade u can get rid of the ads but I'm not doing that!  I will be deleting the app and looking for a different one.
