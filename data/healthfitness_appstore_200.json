"description":"Pokémon GO has now introduced social and trading features that allow Trainers to connect with each other by adding friends, sending Gifts, and participating in a new Friendship level system that unlocks bonuses. Trainers can now trade Pokémon with other Trainers nearby, earning a Candy Bonus for the Pokémon received.\n\nJoin Trainers across the globe who are discovering Pokémon as they explore the world around them. Pokémon GO is the global gaming sensation that has been downloaded over 800 million times and named \"Best Mobile Game\" by The Game Developers Choice Awards and \"Best App of the Year\" by TechCrunch.\n\nVenusaur, Charizard, Blastoise, Pikachu, and many other Pokémon have been discovered!\nPokémon are out there, and you need to find them. As you walk around a neighborhood, your smartphone will vibrate when there’s a Pokémon nearby. Take aim and throw a Poké Ball… You’ll have to stay alert, or it might get away!\n \nSearch far and wide for Pokémon and items\nCertain Pokémon appear near their native environment—look for Water-type Pokémon by lakes and oceans. Visit PokéStops and Gyms—found at interesting places like museums, art installations, historical markers, and monuments—to stock up on Poké Balls and helpful items.\n \nCatching, hatching, evolving, and more\nAs you level up, you’ll be able to catch more-powerful Pokémon to complete your Pokédex. You can add to your collection by hatching Pokémon Eggs based on the distances you walk. Help your Pokémon evolve by catching many of the same kind. Choose a Buddy Pokémon to walk with and earn Candy that will help you make your Pokémon stronger.\n \nCompete in epic Gym battles\nYou’ll join one of three teams and battle for the ownership of Gyms with your Pokémon at your side. As your Charmander evolves to Charmeleon and then Charizard, you can battle together to defeat a Gym and assign your Pokémon to defend it against all comers. \n\nTeam up to defeat powerful Raid Bosses\nA Raid Battle is a cooperative gameplay experience that encourages you to work with up to 20 other Trainers to defeat an extremely powerful Pokémon known as the Raid Boss. If you succeed in defeating it in battle, you’ll have the chance to catch an extra powerful Pokémon of your own!\n \nIt’s time to get moving—your real-life adventures await!\n\nNotes: \n\n- This app is free-to-play and offers in-game purchases. It is optimized for smartphones, not tablets.\n- It is recommended to play while connected to a network in order to obtain accurate location information.\n- Compatibility is not guaranteed for devices without GPS capabilities or devices that are connected only to Wi-Fi networks.\n- Compatibility information may be changed at any time.\n- Information current as of June 18, 2018.\n- Not compatible with 5th generation iPod Touch devices or iPhone 5c or earlier iPhone devices.\n- Please visit www.PokemonGO.com for additional compatibility information.\n- Compatibility with tablet devices is not guaranteed.\n- Compatibility is not guaranteed for all devices.\n- Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically reduce battery life.\n- If you use Pokémon GO with your Apple Watch, with your consent we use the Apple HealthKit APIs to read and/or write certain data (such as Step Count, Calories Burned, and Distance Walked) to the Health App Database on your device (the \"Health App Data\").\n- Trainers of all ages welcome!

"description":"Waking up made easy\n\nSleep Cycle is an intelligent alarm clock that tracks your sleep patterns and wakes you up in light sleep - the natural way to wake up, feeling rested and energized. No need to place your device in bed - Sleep Cycles uses sound analysis sleep tracking.\n\nHow it works\n• As you sleep, you go through different sleep phases, ranging from light to deep sleep and back again. The sleep phase you are in when your alarm goes off is critical for how rested you will feel when you wake up.\n\n• While you sleep, your movements vary depending on what sleep phase you are in. Sleep Cycle’s patented sound technology tracks your sleep patterns using sound or vibration analysis, monitoring your movements in bed throughout the different sleep phases.\n\n• Sleep Cycle finds the optimal time when you are in light sleep to wake you up in the morning, during a predefined 30 minute time window that ends at your set alarm time. Waking up in light sleep feels like waking up naturally without an alarm, leaving you feeling rested and energized.\n\n• All you need to do is turn Sleep Cycle on before going to bed, and place your device on your nightstand or close by on the floor.\n\nContinuously rated as the best smart alarm clock on the market.

"description":"Track how far you walk and how many steps you take. Always on, works on all iPhones. \n\nSteps is a pedometer and activity tracker. It shows you just how much you're moving in a simple, elegant way. Set a goal. As you walk, the colors change to show your progress like a sunrise. No noise, no extra gadget to wear and nothing to distract you. \n\nEveryone should walk 10,000 steps every day for their health, but many of us don't go that far. With Steps, you can easily track how far you go every day, set a goal, and get moving! \n\nWHY STEPS \n\n- Clear, uncluttered design and changing color tells you at a glance how far you've gone today \n- Easily set and adjust goals \n- Calorie tracking, customized for your body and activity\n- Track and share your full activity history \n- Check in quickly from your Apple Watch or Notification Center on your iPhone\n- Integrates with Apple Health to combine data from your Apple Watch or other connected devices\n\nALWAYS ON, WORKS WITH THE PHONE YOU HAVE \n\n- Always on and tracking, no need to press start and stop buttons \n- Works anywhere on your body \n- Works with any iPhone running iOS 7 or greater \n\nBATTERY LIFE \n\nContinued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life. \n\nTo track your activity in the background on the iPhone 4, 4S, 5 and 5c, Steps keeps track of your location. We've gone to great lengths to minimize battery use and make sure your charge still lasts all day, but there's no getting around some impact on your battery.\n\n*** A note on location *** \n\nSteps needs access to your location in order to track how far you walk in the background. If Steps doesn't update while it's in the background, please open the Settings app and go to Privacy -> Location Services. Make sure that you have enabled Location Services for Steps -- this should resolve the issue.

"description":"LOOK NO FURTHER, you have just found the most advanced interval training timer on the App Store. Seconds has been downloaded over 5 million times, and has over 13,000 5-star reviews. Other interval timers don't even come close when it comes to quality, features and ease of use.\n\nBEFORE YOU DOWNLOAD:\nNon-paying users may create and use as many timers as they like, but each timer may only be used once. If the user wishes to use their timers again they may do so by upgrading to the full version.\n\nSECONDS AT A GLANCE:-\n\n• Apple Watch\n• Large clear display\n• Templates for HIIT, Tabata, Circuit Training and more\n• Custom timers to create any intervals imaginable\n• Bluetooth heart rate sensor support\n• Speaks your interval names in your language\n• Loud or soothing alerts\n• Cadence beeps\n• Coordinate music with intervals\n• Universal app, works on all devices\n• External display and AirPlay Mirroring support\n• Runs in the background\n• Supports iOS 9.3 and above\n\nMORE INFORMATION:-\n\n• APPLE WATCH\nSeconds comes with an Apple Watch app that allows you to use your saved interval timers (upgrade required) on your Apple Watch without your iPhone present. It also comes with a Quick Timer editor allowing you to easily and quickly create one-off timers while you are on the go.\n\n• LARGE CLEAR DISPLAY AND COLOUR CODING\nThe timing screen has a large time display that can easily be read from a distance. It works in portrait or landscape. The current interval and next interval are displayed so you can see also what's up now and next. The entire background uses the current interval colour so you don't even need to read the name.\n\n• TEMPLATES MAKE IT EASY TO PROGRAM\nSeconds comes with templates for HIIT, Tabata and Circuit Training making it very easy to quickly create a timer for your workouts. If you require more advanced options, Seconds doesn't let you down. You can create completely custom timers one interval at a time, or even combine timers together to create compound timers.\n\n• HEART RATE SENSORS\nSeconds supports Bluetooth heart rate sensors and allows you to configure the display to show your current heart rate and estimated calories burned during your training session. \n\n• TEXT TO SPEECH AND ALERTS\nThe text to speech option will read out your interval names as you get to them, or even give you some advance warning. Alternatively, you can choose from the built in alerts. These ranges from simple beeps, to MMA air horns and boxing bells, to bells and gongs for more relaxing timers.\n\n• MUSIC INTEGRATION\nSeconds allows you to match the intensity of your music to the intensity of your workout. For each interval, you can select a song, album, artist, genre, playlist, podcasts or audiobooks. If this is not to your taste you can simply play another music source in the background.\n\n• SHARE YOUR TIMERS WITH FRIENDS\nShare the timers you’ve created or completed with your friends on your Twitter, Facebook or Weibo. They will then be able to import your timer into their app.\n\n• EXPORT TIMERS\nTransfer all your timers to another device of yours or a friends easily via Email or AirDrop.\n\n• EXTERNAL DISPLAY\nUse AirPlay Mirroring to display your timers on a big screen. Perfect for personal trainers and fitness class instructors. Enable Privacy Mode so your personal or client timers are not displayed as you navigate the app.\n\n• APPLE HEALTH\nApple Health data is used to calculate calorie expenditure. Workouts can be sent to Apple Health.\n\n• NO FAMILY SHARING OF IN-APP UPGRADE\nFamily Sharing is something that is available for all apps. However, it is Apple's policy to not include in-app purchases with Family Sharing. If you require Family Sharing you should search for Seconds Pro which is a paid app and is therefore is eligable for Family Sharing.", "artistId":"325563420", "artistName":"Runloop Ltd", "genres":["Health & Fitness", "Utilities"], "price":0.00, "bundleId":"com.runloop.seconds.free", "currentVersionReleaseDate":"2018-10-27T22:49:45Z", "primaryGenreId":6013, "isVppDeviceBasedLicensingEnabled":true, "genreIds":["6013", "6002"], "averageUserRating":4.5, "userRatingCount":13355},

Moment is the first and only app on the App Store to do this.\n• Set daily limits on yourself and find a balance for the screens in your life.\n\n\nMoment Family\n• Monitor all of your family member’s screen time too.\n  - Look at your entire family’s day from the comfort of your own device.\n• Start screen-free family dinner time, which means for the next 60 minutes, every time a person in your family picks up their phone or tablet, an annoying alert will go off and everyone will hear it. How embarrassing!\n  - You can decide how long each family dinner time will last.\n  - Everyone in your family can start family dinner time, including your children.\n  - Schedule it for the same time every day.\n• Change a family member’s daily limit and force them to put down their phone when they’re over that limit.\n\n\nThe Highlights\n• Tracks how much you use your phone or tablet automatically.\n• Keeps track of what apps you use the most almost automatically (iPhone only).\n• Trains you with the Coach to use your phone less, if that’s your goal.\n• Logs how many times you pick up your phone each day.\n• Force yourself off your device when you’re over your limit, and force your family members to do the same.\n• Break down each day to see when you’re on your device and what apps you’re using.\n• Tracks where you go each day, and have it plotted on a map.\n• Invisible app. Once you set it up and as long as the app is running in the background, you never have to open it again.\n• Choose from 6 relaxing reminder sounds and 6 intense sounds for your daily limit reminders.\n\n\nApple Watch\n• Quickly see how long you and your family have used your phone today.\n  - You’ll see a colorful icon for each one of your family members on your glance. Green means well under their daily limit, yellow means getting close, and red screams they went overboard.\n• No, the app doesn’t track how long you spend looking at your watch.\n\n\n\nWarning to parents: Moment is not strictly about parental control. Using Moment Family as a parent gives you certain powers, but your children have power too.\n• If your daughter notices you on your phone while you’re supposed to be watching a family movie together, she can start family dinner time for the entire family until the movie is over. That means no one can pick up their phone, and you as the parent can’t turn that family dinner time off.\n• Your entire family can see everyone else’s screen time for the day from the family scoreboard. You can see if your son is over his limit for the day, and he can see if you are over yours!\n\n\nContinued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.

"description":"With Aetna Mobile, your health care is always at your fingertips. \nYou can look up the status of a claim while at your doctor's office. Forgot your Aetna ID card? No problem. Show the staff your virtual card right on your phone. This feature uses your GPS function to help you no matter where you are ― at home or at work, while traveling for vacation or business. A map provides turn-by-turn directions.\n\nFEATURES: \nFIND A DOCTOR, URGENT CARE FACILITY, DENTIST, PHARMACY, HOSPITAL AND MORE\nSearch our network to find the info you need:\n• Get driving directions (uses your GPS function) \n• Call the office or facility\n• View a map \n• Transfer contact information to your address book\n\nSearching on Aetna Mobile is easier and faster than ever. Type your search -- just like you do with your favorite search engine. You can also enter locations like “near me” or a zip code to use your smartphone’s GPS.\n\nLOOK UP CLAIMS\nSee your most recent claims. Get a detailed view of each one. Or search for medical, dental and pharmacy claims by member name or date.\n\nVIEW YOUR MEMBER ID CARD\nView the front and back of your ID cards. That's handy if you forgot your card.\n\nVIEW YOUR PERSONAL HEALTH RECORD\nIf your plan offers a personal health record, you can view your Alerts & Reminders, Emergency Information and Medications. And share data with your health care team.\n\nDISABILITY CLAIM SUPPORT\nAetna Mobile now comes with WorkAbility®. If you have Aetna Disability, you can view the status of your claims and the benefit payments issued on your disability claims.\n\nCHECK BALANCES\nView limits and balances for your deductible and coinsurance. View balances for your health expense funds.\n\nCOMPLAINTS AND APPEALS SUPPORT\nIf you are registered on Aetna Navigator, you can file complaints and appeals on Aetna Mobile. (Medicare members will continue to use the complaint and appeal forms on the Navigator public site.)\n\nSECURITY\nYou must always sign in with your User Name and Password. No one but you can reach your personal data.\n\nAnd once a year we need you to confirm your profile. If your app says it's time to update, log in to the secure site using your computer or mobile web. After you confirm, you can once again access your secure, personal info ― from your computer, Aetna mobile, and this app.\n\nTROUBLESHOOTING\nCan't access all the app's features? \nIf you have more than one Aetna plan or program, the app will prompt you to choose one. Choose your main account. This includes the claims of your current plan. (Some people have Aetna plans from previous jobs; those accounts show only old claims. Other people have financial accounts, such as a health savings account. This is not a main account.)\n\nIs the health plan under your name? (Meaning you are the subscriber or primary account holder.) If so, you can access all the features your plan allows. If you are a dependent, you will have limited access, just like you do when using the secure site on a computer or via mobile web.\n\nABOUT AETNA\nAetna is one of the nation's leading diversified health care benefits companies, serving more than 35 million people with information and resources to help them make better informed decisions about their health care. For more information, see www.aetna.com.\n\nREQUIREMENTS\nThe Aetna Mobile app is compatible with iPhone®, iPod® touch, and iPad® mobile digital devices.", "artistId":"380845819", "artistName":"Aetna Life Insurance Company", "genres":["Health & Fitness", "Medical"], "price":0.00, "bundleId":"com.aetna.aetna", "currentVersionReleaseDate":"2018-10-02T13:52:05Z", "primaryGenreId":6013, "isVppDeviceBasedLicensingEnabled":true, "genreIds":["6013", "6020"], "averageUserRating":2.0, "userRatingCount":1931},

"description":"This application is the most convenient way to keep track of your labor contractions.

The application is designed to keep track of the times, durations and frequency of the entire labor period. \n\nYour full labor history and contraction progress will be saved regardless of whether you restart the application during a contraction or restart the entire device.

Of course, you can also email your contraction history to a health care professional or for your records.\n\nIn addition, you get a full featured Fetal Kick counter and a handy pregnancy reference section that you can use to brush up your knowledge.\n\nTo summarize, some of the features are:\n\nContraction Timer\n* Simple interface to track each contraction\n* View your complete contraction history in chronological or reverse chronological order\n* Edit your contractions in case you forget\n* Manually enter contraction entries if needed\n* Undo your contractions in case you make a mistake\n* Setup Contraction Alerts based on the 5-1-1 rule or customize to suit your needs \n* Track breaking of waters\n* Add a note to any contraction\n* Specify the intensity of each contraction\n* Monitor your labor progression using the built-in graphs\n* Apple Watch Support\n\nKick Counter\n* Full Featured Kick counter\n* View your complete Kick count session history\n* Setup Reminders to make sure you count kicks at the same time every day!\n* Email Kick counting history\n* Customize the session length or the number of kicks counted per session\n* Edit your Kick counting session by deleting accidental entries\n* Add a note to any Kick counting session\n\nWeight Tracker\n* Track your weight gain progress through your Pregnancy\n* Enter Due date information to Weight Gain for Pregnancy Week\n* Attach notes to each weight entry\n* Setup reminders to take your weight at the same time each week\n\n* Great reference section included to provide pregnancy information\n\n* Backup your history to iCloud\n* Resume timing your labor on another device connected to the same iCloud account\n* Configure the duration to monitor and determine trends\n* Email your contraction history to anyone\n* Dark Theme Mode for use in low light conditions to decrease eye strain", "artistId":"382013179", "artistName":"Mustansir Golawala", "genres":["Medical", "Health & Fitness"], "price":0.00, "bundleId":"com.Mustakes.FullTerm", "currentVersionReleaseDate":"2018-05-06T15:36:19Z", "primaryGenreId":6020, "isVppDeviceBasedLicensingEnabled":true, "genreIds":["6020", "6013"], "averageUserRating":5.0, "userRatingCount":4560},

Also it has a history option that allows you to look at the sum of steps for each individual day from day one (your iPhone6's purchase date).\"\n- RoadKingRufus (Mar 5, 2015)", "artistId":"1280299077", "artistName":"Bending Spoons Apps IVS", "genres":["Health & Fitness", "Lifestyle"], "price":0.00, "bundleId":"com.visualhype.pedometer", "currentVersionReleaseDate":"2018-06-13T15:07:07Z", "primaryGenreId":6013, "isVppDeviceBasedLicensingEnabled":true, "genreIds":["6013", "6012"], "averageUserRating":4.5, "userRatingCount":8218},

"description":"** Apple's Best of 2017 **\n\nStress, anxiety, and depression can get in the way of you living your life. Pacifica gives you psychologist-designed tools to address them based on Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, mindfulness meditation, relaxation, and mood/health tracking.\n\nStress, anxiety, and depression are caused by an ongoing cycle of negative thoughts. Thoughts cause physical feelings and emotions which cause actions. Pacifica helps break this cycle using tools that target each of its components. Day-by-day, you'll learn to manage stress, anxiety and depression at your own pace. We’re not about quick-fixes or false promises. We are about real progress, a day at a time.\n\n#1 - BuzzFeed's Amazing Apps For Anyone Living With Anxiety\n#1 - Forbes' 4 Technologies Innovating in Mental Health\n\nTESTIMONIALS\n\n\"This app is not only beautiful and easy to use, it's also an incredibly useful tool that has genuinely changed my way of thinking when it comes to anxiety.\"\n\n“Thank you so much for improving my quality of life.

These include an introductory Path, two Paths focused on CBT, and a mindfulness Path.\n\nMOOD TRACKER\nRate your mood and feelings throughout the day, and add specific notes (the situation, the trigger, etc.) so you can notice patterns and see improvement over time. \n\nTHOUGHT RECORDING, JOURNALING & ANALYSIS\nUse Pacifica’s psychologist-designed thought analysis tools to learn how distorted thinking patterns contribute to your anxiety. Pacifica uses CBT techniques to help you to think in a more balanced way, which helps break the negative thought cycle.\n\nDAILY CHALLENGES & GOAL TRACKING\nPacifica uses CBT techniques to help you to face your anxiety, one day at a time, and gradually work toward your long term goals via daily challenges.\n\nHEALTH TRACKER\nSet and track daily health goals for habits that affect anxiety (exercise, sleep, caffeine, alcohol, etc.). Learn which of these trigger your anxiety based on patterns in your mood. Exercise, sleep and caffeine can also be populated using the Apple Health app.\n\nCOMMUNITIES & GROUPS\nYou aren’t alone in this.

"description":"Cardiio helps you measure your pulse (heart rate) using your phone camera, learn how the numbers relate to your general wellness, perform effective workouts to get in shape, and track your progress.\n*** Featured on The Doctors (CBS), ABC News and more ***\n\nMEASURE YOUR HEART RATE:\n• Just hold your iPhone or iPad in front of your face, or\n• Simply cover the back camera with your finger to read your pulse\n\nGAIN INSIGHT:\n• See how your heart rate relates to your fitness and endurance\n\nIMPROVE YOUR FITNESS:\n• Built-in high-intensity circuit training exercises that only takes 7 minutes to complete\n\nTRACK YOUR PERFORMANCE:\n• Personal dashboard with history (daily, weekly and monthly)\n• Save, edit, annotate, export your data (CSV)\n\nHEALTH KIT INTEGRATION\n• Save your heart rate measurements to the Apple Health app.\n\n*Upgrade to PRO to enjoy the full features of the app!\n\n----------------------------------\n\nABOUT CARDIIO\nCardiio’s technology is based on technology licensed from MIT and originally developed at the MIT Media Lab. MIT has not endorsed Cardiio-Heart Rate Monitor or Cardiio, Inc. \n\nBlood absorbs light. Every time your heart beats, the blood flow to your face and finger increases, causing more light to be absorbed. In between beats, less light is absorbed. By using your smartphone camera to capture tiny changes in reflected light from either your finger or face, Cardiio can calculate your heart rate. \n\n**IMPORTANT TIPS FOR BEST RESULTS \nFor more info, see http://www.cardiio.com/faq\n• ALWAYS hold your phone steady, keep still, and don’t talk during a measurement. \n\nFINGER mode:\n• Make sure your fingers are not cold.\n• Cover the entire back camera lightly with your finger; Don't press too hard to avoid restricting blood flow to your finger.\n\nFACE mode:\n• Look straight ahead and hold your phone around 6 inches in front of your face \n• Be in a well-lit area so your face is well illuminated, but don’t have a bright background behind you (backlit) as it makes your face appear dark in contrast. \n• Make sure your face is clearly visible (e.g. no long hair covering your forehead etc.) so that it can be easily detected. \n\n\nNEED HELP?

Excellent results 285lb squat!\n• I've gained 8 pounds of muscle in 3 months.\n• After 12 weeks I'm now aiming for the 300lb squat and getting my bench above 220lb.\n• In 3 weeks my squat has gone up by 45lb.
