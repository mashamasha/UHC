I would have rated 4 stars but it was only for slight inconveniences that I mention last.  I use this app for tracking my medications, appointments, records and at some Dr locations you can check in on it. I have yet to try that because I forget about it when Iâ€™m there lol. You can also send and receive messages to your provider, AND you can access your medical records on this Healow app. This includes vitals, immunizations, insurance, referrals and more! Itâ€™s pretty amazing and VERY convenient.   They also offer â€œTrackersâ€� where it says you can track MANUALLY, pair a device, and/or they offer items for sale such as the  Fitbit, Nokia, Jawbone fitness devices. Also the iHealth and sleep trackers - but they may be higher priced on this app.   DIABETICS: Thereâ€™s the iHealth blood glucose monitoring package - quite pricey but it may be well worth it for people with diabetes. Just check prices on other websites also, but make sure you can pair with this Healow app if thatâ€™s your goal - to use the tracker on app. Best of all - the app is free and should remain that way!   This app can definitely use some updates as listed below, but overall itâ€™s a GREAT tool for people who want to be in charge of their own health and be their own advocates - which in todayâ€™s times, I highly recommend. YOU are your own best healthcare advocate! Take charge of your health with the new tools offered to us, because Drâ€™s can help us all better if we are organized and in control of our own health. â€œHelp Doctors Help Meâ€� is my motto.

That is fine for short 1 sentence responses from the doctor but any longer message would be difficult to read.  Messages should be opened in a separate window, screen, or in some way separated from the rest of messages and also from the rest of the app.  What is the point of using an app instead of just a website/web portal if it does not take advantage of any of the hardware platform it is running on.  An example of this is the use of PIN codes for access.  Why not use the fingerprint reader (Touch ID on iOS) or facial recognition if the hardware supports it?  Scheduling an appointment is also much more difficult than it needs to be if your doctor is part of a large group.  When requesting an appointment it shows every doctor in the group not just your doctor.  That might not be so bad except that it only shows a small number of doctors at a time.  You then have to scroll down and let it load a small list of more doctors.  Having to constantly keep scrolling to the bottom, wait for it to load a small amount of doctors, and keep repeating this process until you find you doctor is slow and frankly irritating.

I can tell you, up-front, this is one frustrating, poorly designed, sorriest excuse for an app Iâ€™ve had the misfortune to use to-date. Hereâ€™s the problems:  1) Constructing a new strong account password the app will accept should not be the â€œrocket scienceâ€� it seems to be. The password guidelines, some of which they supply on their web portal, are shown nowhere on the app screen where the new password has to be supplied. Showing ALL the guidelines is a common practice among most apps that handle input of of new passwords. Attempting to set a password for a new additional account under Healow seems next to impossible. It rejects them with a â€œNew Password is very weakâ€� message no matter how strong the password really is.  2) Once the user has started the process of adding a new account to Healow, ANY action by the user in navigating to another app before finishing the new account add  will result in the Healow app discarding ALL the information the user has input and take them back to a screen requesting their PIN code when going into settings. Why would a user navigate to another app while doing the new account add? I did it to refer to information needed for the new app addition process, such as the medical practiceâ€™s code and the userid and temporary password supplied by the medical organization, for example. I cannot say how absolutely frustrating and ridiculous this is and would be, especially, to inexperienced users. On this problem, alone, I give the app a â€œ1-starâ€� rating out of 5 stars. It shows exceedingly poor design and even poorer testing practices.  3) When adding an account by hitting the â€œ+â€� in the upper right corner of the My Accounts screen, a screen is brought up in which the user should be able to search by the provider name, practice name, or practice code. However, when that screen is brought up, the app often proceeds beyond it to a list of provider names & addresses as might be useful if the user wants to search by provider name. However, no provider name has been supplied. Getting the screen to stop and allow the user to instead provide a practice name or practice code, as is my case, depends on the user trying to tap the screen in several places across several iterations. Again, this is the result of exceedingly poor design and poorer testing practices.  4) Customer Support is nearly non-existent for this app. Iâ€™ve gone back and forth with these folks about 3 times to try to resolve the password problem. They finally said to just contact the medical provider whose account Iâ€™m trying to add, and theyâ€™ll work it with them. That medical provider isnâ€™t having the problem. I am. This demonstrates their unwillingness to work with their customers to fix problems.

Healow gets the job done (for the most part) but leaves a lot to be desired, especially given every doctor/hospital/practice/insurance provider pushes a different \"all-in-one\" portal destination app and even makes it more difficult for those who don't opt in. Some are better, some are much worse but none are great or offer solutions that would inspire me to refer friends to use it. It seems these apps are just rushed to market in order to check a \"product\" box vs. solve problems/streamline patients' care.   Biggest issues so far:  â€¢ All the alerts informing me of my appointment a week ago. Thanks, but I remember because I was physically there. No need to send an 'alert' 5 days after the appointment, especially if there are no necessary next steps/key details recapped in the summary. Alerts are for new info, not  rehashing memories.  â€¢ Medical Docs: no feature to attach documents to messages within the portal... It's 2017, let's not reinvent the wheel in terms of basic communication needs. What's the point of if users have to use the portal only to then have to request email addresses from docs in order to (insecurely) transfer medical documents? This only adds extra steps and does nothing to expedite.  â€¢ Security: TouchID exists, please include it in your next update. Get up to speed or PLEASE just get out of the App Store. Why download a clunky app if it offers the same experience as a low budget web-site? â€¢ Messaging: the mobile app does not have a way to see sent messages or conversations in thread format. Instead you can only see messages you receive. As most users are not fluent in medical details, referencing back to earlier interactions/context from back and forth with medical staff is important.

Healow gets the job done (for the most part) but leaves a lot to be desired, especially given every doctor/hospital/practice/insurance provider pushes a different \"all-in-one\" portal destination app and even makes it more difficult for those who don't opt in. Some are better, some are much worse but none are great or offer solutions that would inspire me to refer friends to use it. It seems these apps are just rushed to market in order to check a \"product\" box vs. solve problems/streamline patients' care.   Biggest issues so far:  â€¢ All the alerts informing me of my appointment a week ago. Thanks, but I remember because I was physically there. No need to send an 'alert' 5 days after the appointment, especially if there are no necessary next steps/key details recapped in the summary. Alerts are for new info, not  rehashing memories.  â€¢ Medical Docs: no feature to attach documents to messages within the portal... It's 2017, let's not reinvent the wheel in terms of basic communication needs. What's the point of if users have to use the portal only to then have to request email addresses from docs in order to (insecurely) transfer medical documents? This only adds extra steps and does nothing to expedite.  â€¢ Security: TouchID exists, please include it in your next update. Get up to speed or PLEASE just get out of the App Store. Why download a clunky app if it offers the same experience as a low budget web-site? â€¢ Messaging: the mobile app does not have a way to see sent messages or conversations in thread format. Instead you can only see messages you receive. As most users are not fluent in medical details, referencing back to earlier interactions/context from back and forth with medical staff is important.

I was signing up for some service I canâ€™t remember what it was exactly (it wasnâ€™t Teladoc but they was doing some kind of promotional work for Teladoc) but they offered Teladoc services as a additional opportunity to try out. (I believe this may have been when they was possibly still introducing Teladoc) I canâ€™t recall the specific reasoning for all the calls I placed to Teladoc but I do know one of them was for bronchitis that I typically get like clockwork twice a year. It took only minutes to get a call back once requested and the doctor was awesome, he listened to my symptoms and without me stating that I pretty much knew it was bronchitis he determined that it was most likely bronchitis and then proceeded to place me on antibiotics that I picked up within the hour at my pharmacy. It was such a relief for me considering I didnâ€™t have insurance and just waiting out my illness was total misery and my only other option at the time. I recall my other experiences being similar with no complications. I havenâ€™t used Teladoc for a few years now but because of lack of insurance again I decided that it would be my best route considering it would soon be the time of year that I do have one of my battles with bronchitis. I havenâ€™t like I said, used them in several years so I canâ€™t give a to date review and will have to give a follow up review when I do but I see a lot of reviews of unhappy customers complaining of paying fees just to be told to go to their primary physician to receive treatment for issues that the customers are sure what they are and that the Teladoc program claims they treat. I seriously hope that this isnâ€™t a issue because it would definitely be a deal breaker for me. The greatness of this service is being able to get prescription antibiotics the couple of times a year I may possibly need them without paying the high ER bill for a doctor to unnecessarily examine me for a illness I am already positive I have.

Considering the lack of discussion and regard or aid that the physicians bore, my evaluation of this medical means is resultantly lowered. And, with the knowledge of drug contraindications, but what appeared to be a lack of examining my medical history, the doctor might have seen my request wasn't out of line. \"Ice it,\" soak it, keep it clean...not even basic first aid that most people are aware of were his repeated lines, and go to your local doctor if no improvement...suggests apathy from the doctor and, by association, the company. Perhaps it would be wise of Teledoc to re-examine it's processes or check its his busyness or limited time to talk.  I'll likely discuss these unfortunately unfavorable results with my husband about the possibility of refuting charges because this, sadly once more, required about/at least as much time as waiting in a care clinic would have and provider less benefit.  I'm not one who wants to take medications; I've got enough to deal with already. However, when I make a doctor's visit or, in this case, call, though not an emergency, it's typically because I have serious and substantiated reason to be concerned. Now, I'm more concerned to have been duped for my money, which should be a concern for Teladoc.

The doctors generally don’t listen and want to argue with me about what’s happening when I already know and just need a prescription.  If you have absolutely no idea of you have the flu and need someone to tell you to go see your doctor or an urgent care, then Teledoc is for you. I know what is going on with my body and I need an appropriate prescription and here in lies the problem.  For example, I get bronchitis-like symptoms and have for years.  Years ago a primary care doc I had before he moved started me on an albuterol inhaler, mucinex and Z-pack when the symptoms reared up.  This has helped me get better every time and avoid bronchitis.  I get this a couple times a year and I have tried waiting it out on several occasions, but without the meds it has lasted 2 months, progressively getting worse until it turns into pneumonia.  So the way to fix it is with these three meds and it gets headed off before it gets real bad.   Getting the Z-pack is impossible because the docs tell me it won’t work.  Well I am 53 years old and heave been dealing with this for over 20 years and it DOES work.  What is the point of Teledoc if they refuse the simple prescription that will solve problem  in a couple days? I’m not looking for narcotics/pain meds, just an antibiotic....that works!

Once I got off of the phone with Carrie, I literally got a call 30 seconds later from the doctor who took my case, Dr. Javvaji. She was also very kind and like-able. She gave me some extra tips to help me with my sinus infection, tips that I never would’ve even thought of on my own. She spoke to me like one of her own patients, which I really appreciated.

Beware using this service in Georgia.   I first contacted Teladoc last Thursday as I had been fighting some allergy and sinus issues for the three weeks prior.  Within 30 minutes of setting up an account I had a video visit with a doctor, a diagnosis of a sinus infection, and a 7-10 day cycle of antibiotics prescribed by the physician. I was told Georgia law only allowed the physician to prescribe three days worth of medication and I would need to call back for another refill.   So I finished my three day prescription on Monday and call Teladoc back to get a refill to keep my antibiotic cycle going. I was told by a rep that because I did not call within 72 hours that I would need another visit to get a refill. She made it clear I needed to call back the next time within the 72-hour window for refills. So, she schedules me a phone visit with another doctor who prescribes another three day supply and makes it clear to me I need to call within 72 hours to have my prescription refilled again to complete the cycle.   Thursday morning, within the 72 hour time window, I message Teladoc about a refill and am told I need to see a primary care physician. I call the number and speak with a representative and she tells me I did the right thing and someone from the Rx team would contact me to get the prescription refilled.   I get the call from a nurse, who transfers me to the Operations Manager, who then tells me that everyone I spoke to previously was wrong and that Teladoc can not refill the medication their doctors prescribed to me. After two visits, three people telling me to call within the 72 hour window, and two hours back and forth with representatives I am denied further care with the reason being everyone I had spoken to previously was incorrect. I explained again that I was given a 7 to 10 day treatment plan by Teladoc doctors but no help.   Needless to say, I cant schedule a visit with my PCP for over a month due to their backlog. I am feeling somewhat better but not 100% and Teladoc did not show they care about making sure I am well. The Operations Manager even agreed with me that I am on my own and out of luck.   In summary, avoid using this service in the state of Georgia. Teladoc staff do not know the rules and no matter how many times someone tells you to do something, there is a caveat to that; they will deny service and really act like they donâ€™t care about your health at all due to the laws regarding their practices in Georgia.

I’m getting no phone calls no notifications that someone is trying to contact me. I check the app and then I check my email. Sure enough I get an email saying my apt has been cancelled. That a doctor had tried to contact me 3 times. Now that I’ve  been waiting for almost 3 hours I am really annoyed and upset for waisting so much time. I call again and talked to someone to figure out what happened. Why I didn’t receive a phone call. He said it showed that there was an attempt by a doctor to contact me. I let him know we did a test call and that came through. I checked my phone to make sure i didn’t miss any call and the last call that showed was from the “test” call.

They actually charged me the full specialist fees like exactly what you would pay to see specialist doctor.

Teladoc FAQ web page clearly states the doctor is allowed to prescribe it. So I was tricked into believing I’m going to see real doctor.

Long story short, I was trying to avoid sickening others and just making a call in hopes of getting an antibiotic because I was increasingly ill and my mucus was greenish yellow. To no avail, he told me to take Sudafed. Ok, letâ€™s try it. Sure. That and mucinex. Two days later I was worse and my ears were clogged.

Years ago a primary care doc I had before he moved started me on an albuterol inhaler, mucinex and Z-pack when the symptoms reared up.  This has helped me get better every time and avoid bronchitis.  I get this a couple times a year and I have tried waiting it out on several occasions, but without the meds it has lasted 2 months, progressively getting worse until it turns into pneumonia.

Porting it to get a new place would probably now take another 4 hours, so just paid yet another $5 to talk to yet another doctor just to get the prescription sent to the right place. Itâ€™s been ten minutes since the call and I donâ€™t see a new prescription. I can tell that Iâ€™m going to end up at my doctorâ€™s office in the morning, having been up all night trying to get this prescription and $10 poorer for my efforts. So far, Teladoc was a massive waste of my time. And money.

I immediately was given steroid shots, antibiotics and told never to use the service again. nothing I would say would let him hear me. I’ve dealt with colds, bugs, etc. I’m a mother. I know what they feel like in MY body. This was something that needed more care. I was in pain and this experience was more harmful than good.

I was signing up for some service I can’t remember what it was exactly (it wasn’t Teladoc but they was doing some kind of promotional work for Teladoc) but they offered Teladoc services as a additional opportunity to try out. (I believe this may have been when they was possibly still introducing Teladoc) I can’t recall the specific reasoning for all the calls I placed to Teladoc but I do know one of them was for bronchitis that I typically get like clockwork twice a year. It took only minutes to get a call back once requested and the doctor was awesome, he listened to my symptoms and without me stating that I pretty much knew it was bronchitis he determined that it was most likely bronchitis and then proceeded to place me on antibiotics that I picked up within the hour at my pharmacy. It was such a relief for me considering I didn’t have insurance and just waiting out my illness was total misery and my only other option at the time. I recall my other experiences being similar with no complications. I haven’t used Teladoc for a few years now but because of lack of insurance again I decided that it would be my best route considering it would soon be the time of year that I do have one of my battles with bronchitis. I haven’t like I said, used them in several years so I can’t give a to date review and will have to give a follow up review when I do but I see a lot of reviews of unhappy customers complaining of paying fees just to be told to go to their primary physician to receive treatment for issues that the customers are sure what they are and that the Teladoc program claims they treat. I seriously hope that this isn’t a issue because it would definitely be a deal breaker for me. The greatness of this service is being able to get prescription antibiotics the couple of times a year I may possibly need them without paying the high ER bill for a doctor to unnecessarily examine me for a illness I am already positive I have.  Only time will tell but I will definitely be doing a updated review once I have experienced how their service is now."}, {"title": "Teladoc great idea", "author": "hurt Leo", "authorUrl": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id818466956", "rating": "5", "date": "2018-10-09T15:29:24-07:00", "voteSum": "0", "voteCount": "0", "content": "Quick, doesn’t charge insurance an easy on my wallet,thanks"}, {"title": "Amazing", "author": "Cptbtf", "authorUrl": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id232327394", "rating": "5", "date": "2018-06-08T06:45:39-07:00", "voteSum": "0", "voteCount": "0", "content": "I’ve used Teladoc for couple of years .

I’ve been 300+ miles away from home fighting fires and been able to speak with a doctor then pick up a prescription in my fire truck with no interruption to my job.  Breathing in all the smoke we do, I frequently get sinus infections and this is the easiest way to get antibiotics before the infection turns into bronchitis, cough, and a fever etc...    If you are sick and know what you need this is the service for you.  If you don’t know what your issue is and need tests and prefer 1 on 1 with a Doctor in person, this probably isn’t for you.  If you live a long distance from an Urgent Care Clinic or you have little ones at home and don’t have someone to watch them while you go to the doctor, this might be a better option.  No one wants to lug healthy kids into a waiting room full of sick patients to sit and wait for hours to be seen...   I have only had 1 time using Teladoc where it took 15 minutes to get a call back.  The consultation went fine but the clinical team was backlogged so it took over 20+ hours for my pharmacy to receive the prescription.  Had I picked a 24hr pharmacy, it might not have taken as long. Typically from the time I submit a request for a consultation to the time I receive a text from my pharmacy letting me know my medication is ready for pick up is about 20 minutes."}, {"title": "Latest update broken on iOS 9.0.x", "author": ".._.frank", "authorUrl": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id228927034", "rating": "1", "date": "2018-10-19T17:32:48-07:00", "voteSum": "0", "voteCount": "0", "content": "Title says it all.

I'm excited that it includes such extensive features beyond simple medication reminders - opportunities to track refills, sleep, BMs, nutrition, water, etc - but it's too buggy to use reliably right now. Its main buggy issue is that it gets stuck in an infinite loop of refreshing; I can't actually check things off my list when I do them because it's refreshing ad nauseam without fully loading! I'd also suggest some standardization on the Feelings feature - either some standard inventory of feelings, or the option to easily view what individual feelings you've listed in the past so you can check if those are worse, same, or better.

Anyway: tried closing and launching both apps in various orders, same result. Deleted Dropbox & re-installed it, same result. Tap settings -> cloud symbol under Backup -> Dropbox; Dropbox launches and says “Capzule PHR Free would like access to files & folders in your Dropbox” -> tapping Allow causes the “Authorizing” box to momentarily appear, then Capzule reopens to the account page and the News folder flashes blue two times... but the only message in the folder is the Version 2.0.1 announcement.

Use of Dropbox pops up authorization window but no backup is ever performed (screen blinks after allowing access and then drops back to Capzule). Initiating local network transfer fails as Capzule never opens up the designated port.  b) HTTP connectivity: issue resolved - desktop multi-network control sequence Dropbox connectivity: issue not resolved; even after rebooting Capzule client devices the Dropbox Authorization process appears to work but no backup file is uploaded; screen immediately returns to Capzule"}, {"title": "Love this app, but some issues and enhancements", "author": "mikeindm", "authorUrl": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id38118866", "rating": "5", "date": "2017-11-27T17:30:08-07:00", "voteSum": "0", "voteCount": "0", "content": "Love the app, glad to see it back. I can deal with the ads, but would like to see a new pay version.  DropBox isn’t working for me. When I go into the tools or the backup, it asks me to allow the program to access Dropbox but it never lets me do a backup. I can backup to Google Drive with no problem.   I would like to see a way to remove data. I track my blood sugar and insulin usage daily. That’s 365 entries in a year and all I really need access to is the most recent 90-120 entries. Maybe a way to delete by date range? Or even a way to quickly mark a screen full of entries to delete.   Finally, I would like to store templates separately from my data. Lacking a way to mass delete data, I was thinking I could copy a template into self monitoring and call it Diabetes 2017, then copy it in as Diabetes 2018 and simply delete 2017 at some point.

Very useful & largely functional. But one concern is always, how to make sure your info is secure beyond just living on your phone?   I like to backup to a separate iPad when possible using Dropbox. That quit working a few weeks ago. The developer released an upgrade that was supposed to fix that. But now when I try the backup, I get sent to my Dropbox app to approve Capzule’s access. When I click to Allow, I get sent right back to the Capzule app with no backup happening. Try the backup again, get sent back to Dropbox again to allow access. OVER AND OVER. Something is not communicating right between those two. Please help!  Edit to add: developer contacted me, I can’t respond by e-mail or on their website though - only though the App Store on my phone, which I hate. Anyway: tried closing and launching both apps in various orders, same result. Deleted Dropbox & re-installed it, same result. Tap settings -> cloud symbol under Backup -> Dropbox; Dropbox launches and says “Capzule PHR Free would like access to files & folders in your Dropbox” -> tapping Allow causes the “Authorizing” box to momentarily appear, then Capzule reopens to the account page and the News folder flashes blue two times... but the only message in the folder is the Version 2.0.1 announcement. If I try to backup again the whole process repeats again. This is on an iPhone SE running 11.1.1 although I believe I was having difficulty backing up back on iOS 10. The newer version of Capzule seems to have introduced this endless loop though."}, {"title": "Русский перевод нереален", "author": "1_1bzzzzz1_1", "authorUrl": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id185575825", "rating": "1", "date": "2012-10-14T03:18:51-07:00", "voteSum": "0", "voteCount": "1", "content": "Пользоваться невозможно"}]}, {"name": "Health Tracker & Manager for iPhone - Personal Healthbook App for Tracking Blood Pressure BP, Glucose & Weight BMI", "id": "366266931", "url": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/health-tracker-manager-for-iphone-personal-healthbook/id366266931?mt=8&uo=4", "price": 3.99, "userRatingCount": 110, "currentVersionReleaseDate": "2015-10-01T20:06:09Z", "avgUserRating": 4.0, "description": "Health Tracker PRO is the most comprehensive and complete health tracking application available on the App Store which includes all the three common health problems which can be tracked at home:  * Blood Sugar * Blood Pressure - Systolic, Diastolic, Resting Heart Rate (Pulse) and Mean Arterial Pressure * Body Mass Index - Weight, Height and BMI   Why buy three different apps to track BP, Sugar and BMI individually when you can have all of them packed in one and better than that - for a price which is less than half of all of them put together.

(2) Daily/Weekly/monthly overlay (by time) graphs would be nice too. Lastly, (3) I'd like not only a % in range but a % above and % below.  Just more information.  FANTASTIC app overall.  Great job!  Keep up the great work!"}, {"title": "It's getting there...", "author": "eonshadow", "authorUrl": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id30175684", "rating": "3", "date": "2010-11-21T19:33:41-07:00", "voteSum": "0", "voteCount": "0", "content": "Let me start with this statement.

Forget having to wait months to see a specialist, skip the crowded waiting room, and speak with our top doctors now! With Healee, you can also keep a comprehensive health record, connect with your own doctor, and use the Artificial Intelligence (AI) guided Healee Chat to better understand your symptoms.  FEATURES *********************** - Get professional advice from leading specialists Simply describe your symptoms, attach pictures and share test results (if applicable), and a doctor will reply with an expert advice and treatment options. You can now request a consultation within seven specialties: endocrinology, urology, imaging diagnostics, gastroenterology, ophthalmology (eye diseases), orthopedics and traumatology. Stay tuned - we are gradually expanding the range of available specialties!  - Track your health We let you store and manage all your past and present symptoms and conditions, log treatments, set medication schedules and reminders, check drug and allergy interactions, upload lab results and images, and explore your health data using a set of visual charts and reports. The feature integrates with Apple's HealthKit.  - Better understand your symptoms with Healee Chat Our AI-guided Healee Chat is the far better alternative of googling your symptoms, guessing and needlessly worrying. Enter your symptoms, and Healee Chat will ask questions to narrow down the potential explanations, and then provide a list of conditions that could explain your symptoms, along with a next-steps advice or the option to refer you to the right specialist.  - Keep your personal doctor close Besides seeing one of our specialists, you can also connect and stay touch with your own doctor. You can share your health data, so that your doctor can closely monitor your health in real time and notify you should a problem occur.  - Share with people like you The best advice about a health condition often comes from other people in the same boat as you. You can easily and safely share your data on health forums and communities, to ask for people's help and advice.  FAQs *********************** - Who are the doctors? All doctors with whom you can connect via Healee, certified and practicing in the EU, are carefully hand-picked to give you top quality care and expertise.  - How do doctor consultations work? You send a description of your problem, along with pictures, and you get a response from one of the doctors, within 16 to 48 hours, depending on what delivery priority you choose. The response contains information about your condition, together with treatment advice.  - Can I use Healee with my doctor? Yes. Besides seeing one of the specialists who work with us, you can also connect and stay in touch with your own doctor, or any other doctor you choose. The respective doctor just needs to install our dedicated Healee MD application and you can then connect by scanning the doctor’s code from within the Healee application.  - Is my personal and medical information safe? Yes. Both your health and privacy are our top priorities. Even we do not have access to any sensitive personal data that can potentially identify you. We do not have access to your email address, and the images and messages you exchange with doctors. All this data is stored encrypted on our servers and apart from you, only doctors have access to it.  - Can doctors prescribe medications through Healee? No, initially, we are not going to offer prescriptions. However, we are planning to introduce this option soon - doctors will write prescriptions for non-controlled medications that can be fulfilled within the European Economic Area (EEA) countries.", "recent_reviews": [{"title": "Problem connecting to to Healee", "author": "chaosdharma", "authorUrl": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id193012099", "rating": "1", "date": "2017-09-15T15:37:50-07:00", "voteSum": "0", "voteCount": "0", "content": "App does not open.

For Medicare beneficiaries and their caregivers, iBlueButton lets you automatically login into your account at MyMedicare.gov and retrieve your medical history over the last three years to your phone or tablet. iBlueButton organizes all your information with lists of medications and diagnoses which you can research and annotate. Find all your physician visits, hospitalizations, tests or get the contact information of all your providers. iBlueButton also works with the MyHealtheVet and Tricare portals to retrieve your Blue Button health records the VA and the Military Health System.   iBlueButton enables you to easily pull, assemble, annotate, research and securely store your health records directly on your mobile devices so that your most critical health information is available at any time. A multi-profile application, iBlueButton lets you manage your own health records and that of your loved ones who you are helping manage their care.   • Life and Cost Saving - On average every year, a Medicare beneficiary sees seven different physicians in four different locations, and most of the time anyone of these physicians don’t have a view of the full medical history of their patients, which can be the cause of medical errors, unnecessary tests, and avoidable healthcare expenses. Veterans and military personnel & their families experience the same healthcare issues, as their care takes place in VA / military health facilities, and the private sector. iBlueButton helps you prevent dangerous medical errors by delivering anytime-anywhere access to your list of current medications, diagnoses, and medical history, along with contact information for your physicians and family caregivers. iBlueButton reduces unnecessary costly or redundant tests, imaging services, and procedures by sharing your past tests and procedures with your doctors.   • All in Your Hands - iBlueButton pulls and organizes all records in a Summary Record, with all critical information in easy to view sections for medications, conditions, immunizations and allergies.  • You in Control - iBlueButton gives you control over your health records or that of your loved ones. With iBlueButton you can look up, research, and annotate medications and side effects, understand obscure medical terminology, and be informed to effectively manage your family’s healthcare with your physicians. With the tap of a button, you can also note medical record errors or mark sensitive information as private that you may not want to share with some providers.  • Secure and Private - Unlike most personal health record applications, iBlueButton stores your information on your own personal device, where it is securely encrypted and unlocked only by you via password or biometric access. None of your data is processed or stored in the cloud or seen by Humetrix as you do not create an account with us. Your health information remains privately kept by you on your device, with no risk of tampering or hacking in the cloud.  • EMR Records via Direct - Automatically receive your summary health records from providers using federally certified EMRs (e.g., Cerner) via the secure Direct protocol. iBlueButton automatically generates Direct addresses for you to give to your physician for you to receive your health record in iBlueButton. Humetrix is committed to secure EMR records access, including via emerging FHIR APIs.", "recent_reviews": [{"title": "Bloatware:  DO NOT BUY", "author": "fmanans", "authorUrl": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id334291151", "rating": "1", "date": "2018-05-15T15:50:11-07:00", "voteSum": "0", "voteCount": "0", "content": "Frequent crashes, timeout errors on VA, Medicare, Tricare sites:  much faster going directly to the site(s) with i.d. password downloading via Blue Button option.

Primarily because its one of the few that has pen support and, for those of us who like to take advantage of the benefits of actually writing instead of typing, this is an awesome feature! It has several other nice features like logging location, photo and video adding, tags, etc. All pretty standard stuff we’d expect in 2018 from an electronic journaling app, right?  Here’s the rub... I’ve been using the app daily for 2 weeks now. I’ve been successful at journaling without any issues maybe 50% of those days. The app frequently does odd things like not saving your entry or, after saving and then trying to edit your post and add to it, not saving any of the additional writing, which may be several pages worth! I’ve accidentally hit the new page arrow at the bottom with my palm, even though I have the palm rejection icon off, and then when I hit delete to delete the new page it deletes my whole entry. Maybe a dumb decision on my part but it would’ve been good to know that deleting an unwanted page also deletes all of your work to that point. When I first started using the app I couldn’t add photos. Now I can add photos but the experience is a bit janky and there’s no easy way to move the photos around in your post without ultimately screwing up your post and be careful...this is when you’re most likely tp delete your whole post...again!!!  I’ve submitted help requests a couple times and have received some response, thank you for that, but have received no responses after several days on my deleted posts issue. I can see the whole post in the timeline on the left but when I click on it to open it and edit it, there is only a half page of writing...out of 3 pages!! Very disappointing.   Oh well, onward and upward I guess. I’ve moved my journaling back to OneNote again as I am a tad more confident in that piece of software.  Maybe one day, if they can make Dyrii a little more user friendly, reliable, and stable, I’ll be back.

Compare creating an entry on Classic to creating an entry with  Dyrii.  Day One classic.

Primarily because its one of the few that has pen support and, for those of us who like to take advantage of the benefits of actually writing instead of typing, this is an awesome feature! It has several other nice features like logging location, photo and video adding, tags, etc. All pretty standard stuff we’d expect in 2018 from an electronic journaling app, right?  Here’s the rub... I’ve been using the app daily for 2 weeks now. I’ve been successful at journaling without any issues maybe 50% of those days. The app frequently does odd things like not saving your entry or, after saving and then trying to edit your post and add to it, not saving any of the additional writing, which may be several pages worth! I’ve accidentally hit the new page arrow at the bottom with my palm, even though I have the palm rejection icon off, and then when I hit delete to delete the new page it deletes my whole entry. Maybe a dumb decision on my part but it would’ve been good to know that deleting an unwanted page also deletes all of your work to that point. When I first started using the app I couldn’t add photos. Now I can add photos but the experience is a bit janky and there’s no easy way to move the photos around in your post without ultimately screwing up your post and be careful...this is when you’re most likely tp delete your whole post...again!!!  I’ve submitted help requests a couple times and have received some response, thank you for that, but have received no responses after several days on my deleted posts issue. I can see the whole post in the timeline on the left but when I click on it to open it and edit it, there is only a half page of writing...out of 3 pages!! Very disappointing.   Oh well, onward and upward I guess. I’ve moved my journaling back to OneNote again as I am a tad more confident in that piece of software.  Maybe one day, if they can make Dyrii a little more user friendly, reliable, and stable, I’ll be back.
