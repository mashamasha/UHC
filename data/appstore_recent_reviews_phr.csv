Besides the fact that you cannot use simple punctuation, like apostrophes, you also cannot reply to your doctors messages. You have to start a whole new message, there is no threading of conversation ability. With a special needs child we sometimes need to go back and forth about things. This helps avoid bringing him into the office where there are sick kids that could pass him germs. A simple cold has almost cost him his life in the past, as he cannot manage the mucus/congestion that comes with one.  Seeing records is difficult at best. Tests results come in, eventually. But not always in a timely manner.  Good luck with the app! I hope they make it better as it COULD be an invaluable resource. As of now, itâ€™s just a pain."

Keep getting â€œspecial characters like â€˜ are not allowed. please remove them and try again.â€� I have literally removed every single piece of punctuation (every one) and still get the error message. This also happens if I try to respond through the Healow site on a browser instead of the app. I guess Iâ€™ll have to call on Monday and leave a message for the nurse.   Another flaw: my last name starts with two capital letters and Healow wonâ€™t let me have my correct name.  Please fix these. Please.

I would have rated 4 stars but it was only for slight inconveniences that I mention last.  I use this app for tracking my medications, appointments, records and at some Dr locations you can check in on it. I have yet to try that because I forget about it when Iâ€™m there lol. You can also send and receive messages to your provider, AND you can access your medical records on this Healow app. This includes vitals, immunizations, insurance, referrals and more! Itâ€™s pretty amazing and VERY convenient.   They also offer â€œTrackersâ€� where it says you can track MANUALLY, pair a device, and/or they offer items for sale such as the  Fitbit, Nokia, Jawbone fitness devices. Also the iHealth and sleep trackers - but they may be higher priced on this app.   DIABETICS: Thereâ€™s the iHealth blood glucose monitoring package - quite pricey but it may be well worth it for people with diabetes. Just check prices on other websites also, but make sure you can pair with this Healow app if thatâ€™s your goal - to use the tracker on app. Best of all - the app is free and should remain that way!   This app can definitely use some updates as listed below, but overall itâ€™s a GREAT tool for people who want to be in charge of their own health and be their own advocates - which in todayâ€™s times, I highly recommend. YOU are your own best healthcare advocate! Take charge of your health with the new tools offered to us, because Drâ€™s can help us all better if we are organized and in control of our own health. â€œHelp Doctors Help Meâ€� is my motto. Best wishes and health to all! ~Andrea ğŸ˜Š  ğŸ›� APP DEVELOPER SUGGESTIONS ğŸ›� -It would be nice if we could EDIT medications instead of having to hide them and create a new one.  -Also a DELETE med so our â€œhiddenâ€� meds donâ€™t get so cluttered.  -Change log in to at least 5 minutes before we have to enter access code again.

In reality, you have to shut *everything* in Keyboard off if you want your message to your provider to go through; if any of the keyboard options are turned on, you get an error that states that â€œspecial characters such as â€˜ are not accepted.â€� Now who TH writes an app like that?

It frequently locks up while trying to load up the data from the section selected in the interface.  Their website seems to also suffer from this problem.  It is slow and pages lock up while loading data.  Messages from the doctor show up in small text at the bottom of the screen.  That is fine for short 1 sentence responses from the doctor but any longer message would be difficult to read.  Messages should be opened in a separate window, screen, or in some way separated from the rest of messages and also from the rest of the app.  What is the point of using an app instead of just a website/web portal if it does not take advantage of any of the hardware platform it is running on.  An example of this is the use of PIN codes for access.  Why not use the fingerprint reader (Touch ID on iOS) or facial recognition if the hardware supports it?  Scheduling an appointment is also much more difficult than it needs to be if your doctor is part of a large group.  When requesting an appointment it shows every doctor in the group not just your doctor.  That might not be so bad except that it only shows a small number of doctors at a time.  You then have to scroll down and let it load a small list of more doctors.  Having to constantly keep scrolling to the bottom, wait for it to load a small amount of doctors, and keep repeating this process until you find you doctor is slow and frankly irritating.  Also why are the doctors sorted alphabetically by first name.  Some doctors are referred to by their first name by patients but most are referred to by their last name."

healow,595012291,3857,3.5,One of THE Sorriest Apps Iâ€™ve Ever Used,gclunsf,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id260662663,1,2018-02-27T13:33:12-07:00,0,0,"Iâ€™m retired with about 40 years of computing experience and about 6-7 years of iPhone & iPad app user experience. I can tell you, up-front, this is one frustrating, poorly designed, sorriest excuse for an app Iâ€™ve had the misfortune to use to-date. Hereâ€™s the problems:  1) Constructing a new strong account password the app will accept should not be the â€œrocket scienceâ€� it seems to be. The password guidelines, some of which they supply on their web portal, are shown nowhere on the app screen where the new password has to be supplied. Showing ALL the guidelines is a common practice among most apps that handle input of of new passwords. Attempting to set a password for a new additional account under Healow seems next to impossible. It rejects them with a â€œNew Password is very weakâ€� message no matter how strong the password really is.  2) Once the user has started the process of adding a new account to Healow, ANY action by the user in navigating to another app before finishing the new account add  will result in the Healow app discarding ALL the information the user has input and take them back to a screen requesting their PIN code when going into settings. Why would a user navigate to another app while doing the new account add? I did it to refer to information needed for the new app addition process, such as the medical practiceâ€™s code and the userid and temporary password supplied by the medical organization, for example. I cannot say how absolutely frustrating and ridiculous this is and would be, especially, to inexperienced users. On this problem, alone, I give the app a â€œ1-starâ€� rating out of 5 stars. It shows exceedingly poor design and even poorer testing practices.  3) When adding an account by hitting the â€œ+â€� in the upper right corner of the My Accounts screen, a screen is brought up in which the user should be able to search by the provider name, practice name, or practice code. However, when that screen is brought up, the app often proceeds beyond it to a list of provider names & addresses as might be useful if the user wants to search by provider name. However, no provider name has been supplied. Getting the screen to stop and allow the user to instead provide a practice name or practice code, as is my case, depends on the user trying to tap the screen in several places across several iterations. Again, this is the result of exceedingly poor design and poorer testing practices.  4) Customer Support is nearly non-existent for this app. Iâ€™ve gone back and forth with these folks about 3 times to try to resolve the password problem. They finally said to just contact the medical provider whose account Iâ€™m trying to add, and theyâ€™ll work it with them. That medical provider isnâ€™t having the problem. I am. This demonstrates their unwillingness to work with their customers to fix problems.  Whatever you do, if you can, avoid this app like the plague!"

Healow gets the job done (for the most part) but leaves a lot to be desired, especially given every doctor/hospital/practice/insurance provider pushes a different ""all-in-one"" portal destination app and even makes it more difficult for those who don't opt in. Some are better, some are much worse but none are great or offer solutions that would inspire me to refer friends to use it. It seems these apps are just rushed to market in order to check a ""product"" box vs. solve problems/streamline patients' care.   Biggest issues so far:  â€¢ All the alerts informing me of my appointment a week ago. Thanks, but I remember because I was physically there. No need to send an 'alert' 5 days after the appointment, especially if there are no necessary next steps/key details recapped in the summary. Alerts are for new info, not  rehashing memories.  â€¢ Medical Docs: no feature to attach documents to messages within the portal... It's 2017, let's not reinvent the wheel in terms of basic communication needs. What's the point of if users have to use the portal only to then have to request email addresses from docs in order to (insecurely) transfer medical documents? This only adds extra steps and does nothing to expedite.  â€¢ Security: TouchID exists, please include it in your next update. Get up to speed or PLEASE just get out of the App Store. Why download a clunky app if it offers the same experience as a low budget web-site? â€¢ Messaging: the mobile app does not have a way to see sent messages or conversations in thread format. Instead you can only see messages you receive. As most users are not fluent in medical details, referencing back to earlier interactions/context from back and forth with medical staff is important.   PS: how does this app have 3.5 stars...?"

Yet, when you contact their support they will tell you that it is *NOT* designed for anyone to use except doctors and medical staff.  Additionally, it appears that if your doctor, pharmacy, et cetera, is not on their list of providers (and it seems a rather limited list) YOU CAN'T MANUALLY ENTER THE INFORMATION. What?? Are you kidding? This is supposed to be where I can store my personal health/medical information and I can only list a doctor if they have subscribed to the DrChrono service????

This particular cold has lasted over 7 days and I thought just maybe a doctor could prescribe me a decongestant and cough medicine since the over the counter medications arenâ€™t worksheets for me. In the past Iâ€™ve had doctors prescribed me medicines for colds with no problem just to give me some relief. I prefer a prescription because itâ€™s cheaper and is usually covered by my insurance (over the counter meds cost so much more!) The Doctor that I spoke to pretty much cold me to get some rest drink lots of fluids and buy more over the counter cold medications. This conversation was much like the one FREE one youâ€™d have with your local pharmacy when seeking medications in the drugstore. Not only did I waste money ($40) I also have to take my sick behind to the drug store and look for MORE cold meds that will probably add up to an additional $40 ğŸ˜ªğŸ¤§ğŸ¤¬

The support staff were so incompetent that I could no longer tolerate the circular conversation. It felt like the twilight zone. Everyone continued to ask if I wanted them to mail me a copy of an invoice that I had access to online. When I tried to explained the issue, the request was escalated to a supposed specialist.

I immediately was given steroid shots, antibiotics and told never to use the service again. nothing I would say would let him hear me. Iâ€™ve dealt with colds, bugs, etc. Iâ€™m a mother.

I stopped at a Walmart and though it was after 7:00 pm the Pharmacy was still open. I asked the Pharmacist for a suggestion to reduce the discomfort. She replied that I likely had Thrush and that there was no over-the-counter remedy. It was now after 8:00 pm. What to do. My Wife and dispatcher suggested I take advantage of the Tele-Doc benefit provided by our company and as time was running out I did just that. I submitted a request per the steps outlined in the App and in a few minutes received a call from a Doctor who also agreed to the Thrush diagnosis. A short time later I was picking up not one but there scrips at the Walmart Pharmacy. The only cost to me being the usual co-pays for the meds.

I was signing up for some service I canâ€™t remember what it was exactly (it wasnâ€™t Teladoc but they was doing some kind of promotional work for Teladoc) but they offered Teladoc services as a additional opportunity to try out. (I believe this may have been when they was possibly still introducing Teladoc) I canâ€™t recall the specific reasoning for all the calls I placed to Teladoc but I do know one of them was for bronchitis that I typically get like clockwork twice a year. It took only minutes to get a call back once requested and the doctor was awesome, he listened to my symptoms and without me stating that I pretty much knew it was bronchitis he determined that it was most likely bronchitis and then proceeded to place me on antibiotics that I picked up within the hour at my pharmacy. It was such a relief for me considering I didnâ€™t have insurance and just waiting out my illness was total misery and my only other option at the time. I recall my other experiences being similar with no complications. I havenâ€™t used Teladoc for a few years now but because of lack of insurance again I decided that it would be my best route considering it would soon be the time of year that I do have one of my battles with bronchitis. I havenâ€™t like I said, used them in several years so I canâ€™t give a to date review and will have to give a follow up review when I do but I see a lot of reviews of unhappy customers complaining of paying fees just to be told to go to their primary physician to receive treatment for issues that the customers are sure what they are and that the Teladoc program claims they treat. I seriously hope that this isnâ€™t a issue because it would definitely be a deal breaker for me. The greatness of this service is being able to get prescription antibiotics the couple of times a year I may possibly need them without paying the high ER bill for a doctor to unnecessarily examine me for a illness I am already positive I have.  Only time will tell but I will definitely be doing a updated review once I have experienced how their service is now."

Every time they tell me to keep doing what Iâ€™m doing and go see my regular doctor if I donâ€™t get better. News flash! I have been trying to get better without medicine and it doesnâ€™t work! In fact, it worsens and causes me problems with my asthma. Each time I have attempted to head off an infection before it turns into an asthma attack, which I explicitly explain. They argue with me and tell me my information is wrong. But whatever. I might as well flush my money down the toilet.

However, the medical expertise and care was highly lacking. It would be a shame to be charged $45 for information that, as a non-professional, I or anyone else could have provided, and which I did already employ. (As inadequate the medical information online can be, I can say Google more assistance than my ""visit"" today.   The doctor was somewhat congenial, and I think probably sincerely, but perhaps was also rushed. It wasn't evident to me he had any desire to stop to listen to what I had to say. I'd try to interject to address what the doctor was saying, but he continued to talk over me. He didn't use the video call option requested/that is supposed to be one of the main benefits of this technology.   Further, I worked in a pharmacy for quite some while, and an orthopaedic surgeon's practice after that, and know a good deal about doctors' needing to weigh the risks of their prescribing privileges, as well as how their advise affects themselves, their employer, and patient physiologically, ethically, and legally. The doctor wouldn't know any of this experience, nor that as someone who likes to be outdoors often, I stay updated on hazardous fauna and flora.    Considering the lack of discussion and regard or aid that the physicians bore, my evaluation of this medical means is resultantly lowered. And, with the knowledge of drug contraindications, but what appeared to be a lack of examining my medical history, the doctor might have seen my request wasn't out of line. ""Ice it,"" soak it, keep it clean...not even basic first aid that most people are aware of were his repeated lines, and go to your local doctor if no improvement...suggests apathy from the doctor and, by association, the company. Perhaps it would be wise of Teledoc to re-examine it's processes or check its his busyness or limited time to talk.  I'll likely discuss these unfortunately unfavorable results with my husband about the possibility of refuting charges because this, sadly once more, required about/at least as much time as waiting in a care clinic would have and provider less benefit.  I'm not one who wants to take medications; I've got enough to deal with already. However, when I make a doctor's visit or, in this case, call, though not an emergency, it's typically because I have serious and substantiated reason to be concerned. Now, I'm more concerned to have been duped for my money, which should be a concern for Teladoc. Thank you doe you're time, Hannah"

The doctors generally don’t listen and want to argue with me about what’s happening when I already know and just need a prescription.  If you have absolutely no idea of you have the flu and need someone to tell you to go see your doctor or an urgent care, then Teledoc is for you. I know what is going on with my body and I need an appropriate prescription and here in lies the problem.  For example, I get bronchitis-like symptoms and have for years.  Years ago a primary care doc I had before he moved started me on an albuterol inhaler, mucinex and Z-pack when the symptoms reared up.  This has helped me get better every time and avoid bronchitis.  I get this a couple times a year and I have tried waiting it out on several occasions, but without the meds it has lasted 2 months, progressively getting worse until it turns into pneumonia.  So the way to fix it is with these three meds and it gets headed off before it gets real bad.   Getting the Z-pack is impossible because the docs tell me it won’t work.  Well I am 53 years old and heave been dealing with this for over 20 years and it DOES work.  What is the point of Teledoc if they refuse the simple prescription that will solve problem  in a couple days? I’m not looking for narcotics/pain meds, just an antibiotic....that works!  Now I get to go spend $160 at Urgent care.  Thanks for nothing Teledoc!"

Then several months later the app suddenly won’t allow me to sign in until I set up three security questions. I understood this was a common request but I was in pain in the night at that moment and don’t remember my password. The app won’t allow me to use saved password and locked my account and asked me to call them after a few times failed trying. I wonder why don’t they send me a email to reminder the customers that they need new security questions, but blocked the access at the moment I need to use the service.

Teladoc,656872607,52732,5.0,Beware in Georgia,SuperSlouch,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id219769620,2,2018-09-06T07:47:37-07:00,0,0,"What could have been. Beware using this service in Georgia.   I first contacted Teladoc last Thursday as I had been fighting some allergy and sinus issues for the three weeks prior.  Within 30 minutes of setting up an account I had a video visit with a doctor, a diagnosis of a sinus infection, and a 7-10 day cycle of antibiotics prescribed by the physician. I was told Georgia law only allowed the physician to prescribe three days worth of medication and I would need to call back for another refill.   So I finished my three day prescription on Monday and call Teladoc back to get a refill to keep my antibiotic cycle going. I was told by a rep that because I did not call within 72 hours that I would need another visit to get a refill. She made it clear I needed to call back the next time within the 72-hour window for refills. So, she schedules me a phone visit with another doctor who prescribes another three day supply and makes it clear to me I need to call within 72 hours to have my prescription refilled again to complete the cycle.   Thursday morning, within the 72 hour time window, I message Teladoc about a refill and am told I need to see a primary care physician. I call the number and speak with a representative and she tells me I did the right thing and someone from the Rx team would contact me to get the prescription refilled.   I get the call from a nurse, who transfers me to the Operations Manager, who then tells me that everyone I spoke to previously was wrong and that Teladoc can not refill the medication their doctors prescribed to me. After two visits, three people telling me to call within the 72 hour window, and two hours back and forth with representatives I am denied further care with the reason being everyone I had spoken to previously was incorrect. I explained again that I was given a 7 to 10 day treatment plan by Teladoc doctors but no help.   Needless to say, I cant schedule a visit with my PCP for over a month due to their backlog. I am feeling somewhat better but not 100% and Teladoc did not show they care about making sure I am well. The Operations Manager even agreed with me that I am on my own and out of luck.   In summary, avoid using this service in the state of Georgia. Teladoc staff do not know the rules and no matter how many times someone tells you to do something, there is a caveat to that; they will deny service and really act like they donâ€™t care about your health at all due to the laws regarding their practices in Georgia. It would be nice if they told me upfront and honest about what kind of service they can provide rather than keeping me on the hook only to dump me to the side when I was nearing conclusion of their prescribed diagnosis and treatment. Donâ€™t make the same mistake I did."

I had an appointment with Dr. Younes at 8:45 EST. He told me that he was going to prescribe an antibiotic and send it to my local Walgreens. I called Walgreens a few hours later and they said they never received my prescription. I sent a message to the doctor as a follow up to the appointment. I called customer service and talked to someone about a quarter after 12. They said â€œsometimes the prescriptions get lost before theyâ€™re sentâ€�. She told me that she would have the prescription resent to the pharmacy. Well by 3pm, it still wasnâ€™t sent so I said to hell with it and went to an immediate health care center. Itâ€™s 4pm now and my prescription is being processed from the immediate care center; the prescription from Teladoc still hasnâ€™t been sent in.   When people are ill, they expect to receive medication in a timely matter to help prevent spreading bacteria and to ease pain. This does not seem like a priority to Teladoc.

Teladoc,656872607,52732,5.0,I love this service!!,Queen SheShe,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id22442412,5,2018-08-16T06:34:02-07:00,0,0,I have always wished for an app of service like this. I highly recommend this app for basic illnesses that aren’t life threatening. I get a RX sent to my pharmacy and if need be a doctors note sent to me. It’s truly a time saver and is soo convenient to use. I mean really... I had the stomach flu.. requested an appointment and within minutes I had meds sent for nausea to my pharmacy. No one wants to sit in a doctors office when they are throwing up with a stomach bug just to get anti nausea meds. Meanwhile infecting everyone you come into contact with. This service is truly amazing.

After another hour waiting, Jason called me and although he was apologetic was also not able to help - though he did offer to switch me from video consultation to phone consultation. Unfortunately for me, that involved starting the wait all over again from the back of the line and losing the two hours of waiting already underway.   Eventually I received a phone call but by then I had already sought additional care at a local urgent care.   If you care about someone, if you love them, if you want them to receive competent care in a timely fashion - avoid this service."

For one, you can schedule an appointment but you cannot reschedule or cancel an appointment via the app. When you want to reschedule or cancel, you have to call in to the Teledoc company. Even then, you either have to wait on the phone for a representative, that ends up having you call somewhere else to get the help you need. In the end, you have to leave a message for someone. Teledoc advertises that it is available 24/7-365, so I can’t understand why you would have to leave a voicemail?! The only positive is that it can occasionally be quicker than getting in to see a doctor. Although, you personal doctor knows you better and is more apt to treat you and your symptoms better."

This part worked great!  I had side effects from the prescription the doctor prescribed so I went back into the Teledoc app to speak to another doctor and I was not able to continue because the app could not verify my medical records. They verified them 2 days ago!  I don’t understand why it worked 2 days ago but not today.  I called customer service and they said I needed to setup a temp account and start my medical history all over again!  This took 30 minutes to set up last time. I decided it would be faster to go to urgent care. I do not recommend this service.  It’s not as easy as it sounds.

It took a long time to set it up with someone on the phone, so I decided to upload my profile through the app. That didn’t take as long. Once I finished setting up my profile I needed to have a video chat for my daughter. I waited 2 hours to only receive a call asking if I could switch my apt to a phone call. At this point I just wanted to talk to a doctor. So I agreed. The lady ran a “test” call to make sure the phone call would come through and it did. Great I’m thinking, I will finally be able to talk to someone. I waited for another hour and as I’m waiting I’m getting notices that doctors are reviewing my profile.   I’m getting no phone calls no notifications that someone is trying to contact me. I check the app and then I check my email. Sure enough I get an email saying my apt has been cancelled. That a doctor had tried to contact me 3 times. Now that I’ve  been waiting for almost 3 hours I am really annoyed and upset for waisting so much time. I call again and talked to someone to figure out what happened. Why I didn’t receive a phone call. He said it showed that there was an attempt by a doctor to contact me. I let him know we did a test call and that came through. I checked my phone to make sure i didn’t miss any call and the last call that showed was from the “test” call.  So ultimately this is not a great option for getting medical attention. I had high hopes that this would be easy, but save your time and energy and call your physician office instead!"

You will see hundreds similar stories, none of them are happy. If you need real care GO SEE A DOCTOR who can actually prescribe a treatment. This is NOT the same. Now my story is below  The doctor recommended me a medication then literally asked me to go see a doctor to get the prescription because Teladoc doesn’t allow them to prescribe it. They actually charged me the full specialist fees like exactly what you would pay to see specialist doctor. And now I have to visit another real doctor physically and pay the same amount I just paid to get the prescription. The irony? Teladoc FAQ web page clearly states the doctor is allowed to prescribe it. So I was tricked into believing I’m going to see real doctor. It’s either the doctor lied or Teladoc lied in their FAQ and they do indeed disallow prescription? I don’t know but I know for sure if I visited real doctor from the beginning I would’ve gotten the better treatment at cheaper cost"

Phone rang with in under a minute. Dr. was very kind and courteous. Called in a prescription for a simple problem within 10 minutes. Two days later the problem was seeming resistant so I went on Teladoc to ask a nurse how long I should wait to notice a difference on the antibiotics. They called me very quickly and had already spoken to the doctor. Was going to call in a new script for me but it was one that I recognized as making me sick in the past so they got hold of the doctor again and then called me back with another new prescription. called in another script to my pharmacy right away. It cost me $45 total. That was my fee for the initial transaction. Could not ask for more. I would highly recommend this to anyone. Cost me at least half of what it would have at my doctors office and I have insurance.

I kept checking the app for when my appointment would occur. Today — it was all gone as if I’d never requested it.

Finally I called customer service and they had a different doctor who called me. I was fine with that and wouldnâ€™t have given them a negative review just for that. I had pink eye and she faxed me a prescription. It was easier than going to the doctor just for pink eye. So that wasnâ€™t the issue. The issue is the billing. It was supposed to be a $40 fee. I entered my PayPal info knowing that I would pay whatever my insurance did not. However, they charged me the full amount right away. I thought, well.. they probably charge it to me until insurance pays and then Iâ€™ll be reimbursed. Nope. I received a letter in the mail from my insurance that they had paid the bill in full. They have on file the date that Teladoc cashed their check for $40. I have never been reimbursed. Somehow they get $80 for a $40 service and their customer service was useless. They would not help me but instead had me call the medical advice line for my insurance who had ALREADY PAID the bill? The fact is they should send me $40 back for overpayment but itâ€™s been 2 months and they are impossible to deal with."

The doctor called promptly and was pleasant enough. I had a chest cold/sinus infection and felt really awful. I donâ€™t usually bother with a doctor on these things, because yes theyâ€™re mostly viral and not to overuse antibiotics. For me to consider a doctor for this type of ailment, I usually am miserable, and only happens once a year or every other year or so. Iâ€™m not a big get-sick type, thank goodness. Long story short, I was trying to avoid sickening others and just making a call in hopes of getting an antibiotic because I was increasingly ill and my mucus was greenish yellow. To no avail, he told me to take Sudafed. Ok, letâ€™s try it. Sure. That and mucinex. Two days later I was worse and my ears were clogged. I didnâ€™t want to chance an ear infection and went to urgicare. They gave me the antibiotic prescription I needed and I began to feel progressively better day by day. I think there is no shortcut to being actually seen by a doctor."

I explained they market this service differently than he is presenting it. Super lackadaisical about it all.  Scheduling the appointment was a hassle as well as he initial doctor did not call me at the scheduled time so I had to contact Teledoc who changed my appointment time to â€œASAP.â€� Really I wouldâ€™ve just liked them to keep a scheduled appointment.

I also work at a call center which is a feeding freezing for passing along that good olâ€™ bacteria, I could have easily caught it from someone. So teladoc was unable to prescribe me antibiotics instead I was told to go to a clinic. I paid 35$ to talk to someone for 5 minutes (if that) via video call to tell me I have to go to the clinic. Donâ€™t get me wrong in the terms and conditions it says youâ€™re not guaranteed to be prescribed medication, but why else would I go to the doctor?

I contacted customer service just to know they canâ€™t give me a refund.  I just want to add, donâ€™t use Teladoc as it is a fraud and they canâ€™t treat you.

When I got the 2nd call it was from another primary teladoc that said they arenâ€™t allowed to provide refills of any antidepressants.

I donâ€™t use this unless Iâ€™m certain about an issue and itâ€™s easier for me to use the app then go in or haul little kids in. One incident was when I knew my daughter had a UTI and we had a horrible blizzard coming in. The doctor refused to do anything, even though itâ€™s on the list of things they can treat, and we were still charged for the visit. I then had to rush to urgent care where it was confirmed but by this time the blizzard had come in and we couldnâ€™t make it to the pharmacy due to there being accidents everywhere. We were lucky we made it home. I also know when my kids have an ear infection. Itâ€™s usually a secondary infection that follows a cold for them and then they get a fever and ear pain. I had 2 kids with these symptoms and it was a Saturday. I requested visits for both on teladoc. One doctor for one child said â€œYes, thatâ€™s typical of an ear infection so I will send over the prescription to the pharmacy.â€� And the other doctors gave me a really hard time and acted like I didnâ€™t know what I was talking about. I was afraid he also wasnâ€™t going to prescribe the antibiotic my son needed but he eventually did. It makes me hesitant to use this but I feel like itâ€™s my only option sometimes. I just hate having to waste money for a visit that ends up being not helpful at all, and itâ€™s for things the app says they can treat."

There is no option to delay this meeting after it has been requested. Unable to sleep because I had a painful UTI, I sat up waiting in this call. That's fine and understandable to me. When I received a call at 2:00am, it wasn't a health professional. A scheduler asked if we could set meeting at 7:00am - leaving me no time to go to the pharmacy before my commute to work. Still, I understood; but the scheduler insisted a doctor had tried to call me and was unable to get through. I explained I had been waiting and hadn't received any calls. She proceeded to explain that I most likely didn't answer since they call from private numbers. I protested that I would have answered and she wrote me off. For someone waiting up until 2:00am for a call, with no option to reschedule, while experiencing some level of discomfort - this experience and blatant disregard for the truth - was very upsetting. Don't lie to your customers about calling."

After explaining that Iâ€™ve had a hacking cough for a week (non-smoker), the doctor said that the cause must be viral.  If it was longer than a week, then it was bacterial.  So, couldnâ€™t it be either/or at that point?  She didnâ€™t think so.  2.  If it was bacterial, she said I should get a script for Augmentin.  Problem is, I have a penicillin allergy.  Not exactly observant.  3.  After saying I was producing mucus, she didnâ€™t bother to ask what color it was, which could give an indicator of the cause.  4.  She recommended Mucinex-DM, which is a terrible product to recommend because while the guaifenesin component breaks up the mucus, the dextromethorphan prevents you from coughing it out, so it just sits there in someoneâ€™s lungs.    Bad recommendations.  Bad experience.  Disappointed."

I gave her my symptoms and AGREED with me itâ€™s a small cold, yet the only symptom I have is a SLIGHT runny nose, I live in Kentucky were a pollen bowl thatâ€™s usual.

Signs that any time I go to a doctor with I get put on antibiotics. I was suspicious when I wasnâ€™t put on antibiotics and they just prescribed me with medication to mask the symptoms but I went to the pharmacy anyways. Upon going to the pharmacy I was informed that they prescribed me with medicine my insurance company wouldnâ€™t cover and would cost $70 but I could purchase an over the counter version with the same amount of the same active ingredient for $17. Monday morning I called in sick from work and went to urgent care, they took note of the same symptoms I described to Teladoc and immediately wrote me a prescription for antibiotics which Teladoc wouldnâ€™t do. Teladoc was a waste of time and money for me and delayed me from getting the antibiotics I needed to clear my infection.

Wanted to get on Prozac for my anxiety and depression which Iâ€™ve been prescribed in the past and took myself off. Had a 20 second phone call of a doctor telling me to go see a doctor. They wonâ€™t refund the 25 because 1. They think Iâ€™m a drug addict (as they kept repeating â€œjust because you see a doctor donâ€™t mean theyâ€™ll prescribe pillsâ€�) even though Prozac is non addictive. 2. I got medical advice (him telling me to go see a doctor, as if I wasnâ€™t doing that already) and 3. Because they donâ€™t deal with DEA regulated drug (so they wonâ€™t give you Tylenol I guess?). Itâ€™s 25 dollars. I doubt it makes a difference to them. But they rather get pocket change for themselves than keep a customer. So now I have to wait till next time, as a single father with 2 kids, that I have a little extra money to go see someone who actually can help.  I even put the reason for the visit was â€œanxiety and depressionâ€�. You think they could prewarn you in advance they donâ€™t deal with that? But no. They wanted the 20 second phone call so they can pocket the money. Worse service. Donâ€™t bother. Take their â€œmedical adviceâ€� and just go to a doctor in person. This place ainâ€™t worth the time of day. They donâ€™t care about the customers, only the money. And remember, they canâ€™t even prescribe  you Tylenol apparently so thereâ€™s no point in this unless you want a quick chat to tell you who you should go see instead of them."

Corrected me unprofessionally when I stated I was aware of antibiotic resistance. (Which he should know about as this is a major issue that I agree not everyone needs an antibiotic). Did not listen to my history of present illness and interrupted me when the first two words I said were â€œmy husbandâ€� and stated he only was concerned about my current symptoms not how they were spread. What if we had recently traveled out of the country as a family? It is always important to listen to your patientâ€™s history of present illness before treating the patient as another 8-minute consult product to get reimbursed on instead of an ill human being seeking help innocently. He sounded very conceited and is obviously in this gig for the extra pay.

I'm excited that it includes such extensive features beyond simple medication reminders - opportunities to track refills, sleep, BMs, nutrition, water, etc - but it's too buggy to use reliably right now. Its main buggy issue is that it gets stuck in an infinite loop of refreshing; I can't actually check things off my list when I do them because it's refreshing ad nauseam without fully loading! I'd also suggest some standardization on the Feelings feature - either some standard inventory of feelings, or the option to easily view what individual feelings you've listed in the past so you can check if those are worse, same, or better.

I have introduced this app to my 71 year old grandmother, who is a type 2 diabetic, and she was easily able to record her blood pressure.

The percentage display is steps taken is motivating for anyone to reach their goal. Another one of the many useful features is being able to track the medications you're taking and what you have already taken throughout the day. This gets rid of the confusion if you've forgotten what medicine you've already had. The ability to chose widgets in the home screen makes it more accessible and personalized for the user so that they can see what they need to by just opening the app. I personally recommend this app to everyone because knowing your body is the first step in to living a healthier life.

This app allows that since it’s on my watch! Yes, my box uses Wodify but who has time to try and sift through that while everyone else wants to check theirs too! This app on the watch makes it a split second decision on what weight to use. I also love that you can customize your categories and filters to make the list work with whatever type of workouts you do."

I liked it but only needed to access it once or twice a year. So, when the iOS 11 update came out I was unaware that the app would not work. Fast forward to post iOS 11 update and version 1 no longer works. No backup of my data and can’t find a way to access or import the data to version 2. Poor planning on my part and the developers. They should have made it so we wouldn’t lose the data.  Also, I paid for the first version. Since iOS 11 and up do not support that version, it irritates me that I now must pay again (if I want to lose the adds) for a subscription. Wrong, just wrong."

I use it for all medical consultations and demonstrate it for interested health provider personnel. Most of them are amazed and some express interest in possibly getting it. We are all appreciative of the local only data storage and no Internet connection required.  Two gotchas at this point (01/08/2018) with version 2.0.1 (iPad): a) no direct contact with any application support personnel, b) Dropbox and local network HTTP functionality doesn’t appear to work. Use of Dropbox pops up authorization window but no backup is ever performed (screen blinks after allowing access and then drops back to Capzule). Initiating local network transfer fails as Capzule never opens up the designated port.  b) HTTP connectivity: issue resolved - desktop multi-network control sequence Dropbox connectivity: issue not resolved; even after rebooting Capzule client devices the Dropbox Authorization process appears to work but no backup file is uploaded; screen immediately returns to Capzule"

I wrote in a family history as well so that the kids can print it out and rake it to their own doctor appointments. I was able to upload medical reports and photos (ugh!) of my EGD scope! Incredible. Since my phone calendar doesn’t go back a whole year, I can look at the app to see whenI should get in for my annual exam.  Seriously, this app is all you need to carry around all your medical data for any appointments.  Start keeping your kids’ records with you for all pediatrician visits and jot down when they have all those childhood illnessss."

I can deal with the ads, but would like to see a new pay version.  DropBox isn’t working for me. When I go into the tools or the backup, it asks me to allow the program to access Dropbox but it never lets me do a backup. I can backup to Google Drive with no problem.   I would like to see a way to remove data. I track my blood sugar and insulin usage daily. That’s 365 entries in a year and all I really need access to is the most recent 90-120 entries. Maybe a way to delete by date range? Or even a way to quickly mark a screen full of entries to delete.   Finally, I would like to store templates separately from my data. Lacking a way to mass delete data, I was thinking I could copy a template into self monitoring and call it Diabetes 2017, then copy it in as Diabetes 2018 and simply delete 2017 at some point.

Very useful & largely functional. But one concern is always, how to make sure your info is secure beyond just living on your phone?   I like to backup to a separate iPad when possible using Dropbox. That quit working a few weeks ago. The developer released an upgrade that was supposed to fix that. But now when I try the backup, I get sent to my Dropbox app to approve Capzule’s access. When I click to Allow, I get sent right back to the Capzule app with no backup happening. Try the backup again, get sent back to Dropbox again to allow access. OVER AND OVER. Something is not communicating right between those two. Please help!  Edit to add: developer contacted me, I can’t respond by e-mail or on their website though - only though the App Store on my phone, which I hate. Anyway: tried closing and launching both apps in various orders, same result. Deleted Dropbox & re-installed it, same result. Tap settings -> cloud symbol under Backup -> Dropbox; Dropbox launches and says “Capzule PHR Free would like access to files & folders in your Dropbox” -> tapping Allow causes the “Authorizing” box to momentarily appear, then Capzule reopens to the account page and the News folder flashes blue two times... but the only message in the folder is the Version 2.0.1 announcement. If I try to backup again the whole process repeats again. This is on an iPhone SE running 11.1.1 although I believe I was having difficulty backing up back on iOS 10. The newer version of Capzule seems to have introduced this endless loop though."

I can put lab results like blood pressure and cholesterol into Capzule and see at a glance results on a chart. Backup has been smooth and sharing within my devices works fine. At the doctor's office I am able to access any medical info in seconds. I know Capzule needs to place ads to keep developing it so that doesn't bother me. It would be nice to have the option to pay to eliminate the ads like so many other apps do. Thanks for a wonderful app!

It crashes the app.  It actually crashes both versions, repeatedly and reliably.  Since there is no other way to restore data from the previous version, I'm stuck.  Time to migrate to something else I guess.  UPDATE: I was able to restore from backup using dropbox.  The airdrop issue was limited to the iPad, but I could not get an iPhone and iPad to recognize capzule on each device.  The instructions and capabilities provided are in some cases incomplete and in others wrong, as they refer to capabilities that do not function."

However, I felt compelled to do so because I can't imagine keeping track of my families medical records without this app. When I learned that it would not be supported in iOS11, I downloaded over 10 other PHR apps but none even came close to what this one can accomplish.  Andaman7 was the best alternative I found , but the lab tracking leaves much to be desired.  Capzule is by far the easiest to use, most comprehensive in terms of what info you can store, and has the best UI of any PHR app out there. My only wish is that I could pay them a lump sum to remove the adds. But the company has to be able make money to keep developing the app.  Thank you soooooo much for keeping this app going."

I say that, because they have not responded to ANY emails I have sent.  1.  The dashboard - it only displays the latest entry for a metric.  It should be showing a total average.  Additionally, to select a metric for entry, you have to find it on a little menu on the bottom.   We should be able to just touch that section on the dashboard.  2.  No provision for mass data import, in order to bring old info from another program in.  Export seems to be limited to sending an email to yourself.  It seriously needs a inport/export component.  3.  The use of wheels for data entry is insane.  Some entries can vary widely, and it would be more efficient to use a keypad for the numeric entries.  Fast, simple, and easy to work with.

I enter 221 and 67 inches and it shows up as 220 and 66 inches. What is up with that. This app needs some work. I would guess internally it is storing things in kg and meters and the conversions to pounds and inches are causing some issues. Likely because of the internal resolution it is being stored in.

First, you need the ability to edit previous entries. I realized, after I clicked ""save,"" that I must have inadvertently moved my height dial when entering my weight--now the graph for my BMI on that date takes an odd turn, as well as my height line.   Speaking of the height curve--it's totally unnecessary. This data point should be set on the same screen where we set our unit preferences. It certainly doesn't need its own number wheel next to the weight wheel, nor its own line on the BMI chart-- I think it's safe to assume that this is fairly constant in most people and if, for some reason, it must be corrected, it should be done in the settings menu.   On the plus side, I think the navigation and data entry is very easy and simple, and the adjustable graph function is very nice and easy to read."

A complete and utter joke.   - Don't waste time with this app. It may actually make you sicker. - Don't pay for a Hello Health medical records subscription. Any tech company that embraces Flash and doesn't build their web services for mobile first is wildly incompetent, and unworthy of safeguarding your medical information. - Tell your doctor to find a new medical records provider."

So, I have to go to my desktop to retrieve the document (not everybody has a desktop nowadays). By the way, not that it’s related to the app, the desktop experience is far from being intuitive and is built entirely in Flash.

I tried several free apps & overall have been happiest with this one. I especially like the Google Health interface. My only request would be an option to manually input readings via some keypad/scroll wheel method like the other apps (perhaps this could be a user enables option?). I sometimes have trouble getting the slider exactly where I want it, & I just think a more straightforward input method might be convenient for some people.

The interface can be infuriating. I want to be able to graphically see where my blood sugars are, but not have to place them graphically. An option to add blood sugars with using the telephone layout keypad would provide a fast entry solution. I would like to be able to send my insulin intake to google health. please add support for this. additionally, i would like to be able to log my carb intake.

You can customize as many categories as you want, such as Pre-Lunch, Post-Lunch, Other, Fasting.  You can set as many of these as you want. 2. it is very easy to place the dot.  What you do is slide around until you find your number, then pause there for a few seconds and it will lock it in.  You DO NOT have to let go at just the right spot. If it is wrong (which seems rare for me) you can just touch it and move it again.  My only complaints are that (1) the X and Y axes of the graph are flipped compared to most blood sugar graphs.  From left to right you have the reading, and up and down is time of day. If there was an option to change that so that it could be shown either way this would be a 5 star app! (2) Daily/Weekly/monthly overlay (by time) graphs would be nice too. Lastly, (3) I'd like not only a % in range but a % above and % below.  Just more information.  FANTASTIC app overall.  Great job!

Often when we see doctors we get A LOT of handouts about treatment plans, etc... I would really like to upload those to this medical app so everything is in one place. You also really need to have a way to track symptoms, like when my child is sick or running a fever, I’d like to track his temperature, when he has last vomited, etc... I would also like to be able to track height, weight, BP, pulse and even better would be peak flow measurements. Also, with the medicine, a way to track when medication is taken and due, etc..

This program is simple and straightforward, very easy to use. You don’t have to use a proprietary cloud to save your data. It saves/retrieves your data to either the iCloud or Dropbox which is great. It’s one disadvantage is that it is a bit inflexible. This is a very promising application that would be great with a few minor additions. The single item I would suggest to improve is adding the capability to add tests. I have had several lung, kidney, bone marrow and liver biopsies, but I cannot enter them because these aren’t in the fixed list. I am sure there are many other types of tests that aren’t listed. The graph function doesn’t work properly but this is minor. I would also suggest adding a section for date/time of an advanced directive as this is very important."

Primarily because its one of the few that has pen support and, for those of us who like to take advantage of the benefits of actually writing instead of typing, this is an awesome feature! It has several other nice features like logging location, photo and video adding, tags, etc. All pretty standard stuff we’d expect in 2018 from an electronic journaling app, right?  Here’s the rub... I’ve been using the app daily for 2 weeks now. I’ve been successful at journaling without any issues maybe 50% of those days. The app frequently does odd things like not saving your entry or, after saving and then trying to edit your post and add to it, not saving any of the additional writing, which may be several pages worth! I’ve accidentally hit the new page arrow at the bottom with my palm, even though I have the palm rejection icon off, and then when I hit delete to delete the new page it deletes my whole entry. Maybe a dumb decision on my part but it would’ve been good to know that deleting an unwanted page also deletes all of your work to that point. When I first started using the app I couldn’t add photos. Now I can add photos but the experience is a bit janky and there’s no easy way to move the photos around in your post without ultimately screwing up your post and be careful...this is when you’re most likely tp delete your whole post...again!!!  I’ve submitted help requests a couple times and have received some response, thank you for that, but have received no responses after several days on my deleted posts issue. I can see the whole post in the timeline on the left but when I click on it to open it and edit it, there is only a half page of writing...out of 3 pages!! Very disappointing.   Oh well, onward and upward I guess. I’ve moved my journaling back to OneNote again as I am a tad more confident in that piece of software.  Maybe one day, if they can make Dyrii a little more user friendly, reliable, and stable, I’ll be back. Until then..."

There are a lot of things that I would like to see in such an app, but the first thing I want in a journal is the ability to easily write (or otherwise create) an entry. Dyrii doesn’t do that.  Compare creating an entry on Classic to creating an entry with  Dyrii.  Day One classic.  Open the app. Press + Write entry (your first line is your title, which can be changed)  Dyrii Open the app Press + Select from a screenful of icons representing, I think, a mixed bunch of entry methods and tags Start writing (note that there is a separate title field)  Of you want to add a photo to a written entry, Classic: tap on the camera symbol at the bottom of the entry. Dyrii: ?, tho’ you can insert from the menu on the desktop version.   The extra steps are not terrible, but they create enough friction that I’m less likely to use it regularly. For people who sit down once a day to write, the features that this app offers might be compelling, but for me those features are meaningless because I won’t have enough entries to make them worthwhile.   A less important, but equally personal criticism: I really dislike the icon. The color seems muddy and the design is busy.   Sadly, deleting."

This app is password protected, it has unlimited entries, sketching, add afterthoughts on entries, audio, pictures, mood tracker and it is all for free. No tricks or gimmicks. Automatic sync costs a subscription but if you chose to upload both on the iCloud it will sync for free also.   The UI Is simple, easy to navigate and start using. You just click on the + and you can enter a new entry and you can do multiple entries a day. If you want to click into a previous one, it shows the preview. It’s not cluttered, buggy, and it hasn’t crashed on me once. Every time I open the app after going out of it, it opens with a password. Which is perfect. I’m just really happy I came across it and gave it a chance. It is by far better than DayOne or anything else I’ve tried.
