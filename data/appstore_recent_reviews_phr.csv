FitnessSyncer,1159207899,2.5,5,Broken: needs to be updated,devinhedge,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id41659403,0,0,1,"Upon initial install under previous version of iOS, this app seemed just thing needed to sync my Apple Health information to Fitbit, so I purchased the Pro plan and away it synced.

Upon updating both my iPhone, and reinstalling the app for good measure, the app presents me with a blank, black screen before dying after about 30s. Background syncing wasn't happening, instead I was being prompted via notification to launch and manually sync.

The UI isn't that great but is functional. 

CONCLUSION: fix the app.",2017-04-17T04:46:59-07:00
MTBC PHR,499832131,4.5,446,One of the great apps in Apple Store,I.Mind,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id249834354,0,0,5,"wowâ€¦. When i did login to this app i was amazed to see the interactive wheel of PHR. It's color combination and user interaction is gr8. I can rotate the dialer for some time and won't get bore. The design of this app is excellent. I can't login because i am not registered user but i can take the demo. I will keep this app in my iPhone :-)

It would be great if I could see all of that info without having to select the link and go into the actual website, I thought that was what an app was supposed to be for.  

If they added that feature it would be 5 stars.",2017-05-25T18:20:48-07:00

Great features such as password protection, local storage on IPhone, medical info for multiple people and ability to email info in a thorough printout with good logical progression. The App is very user friendly and imports contact info for physicians and emergency contacts directly from your my contacts. I emailed suggestions to the author about possibly adding lab and test result findings as wel as previous injuries and hospitalizations. I recieved a very rapid response back from the author of the App within a few hours. I look forward to updates and future Apps by this author. Thanks for a job well done!",2009-12-31T11:32:46-07:00

I now have a way to check all past and future appointments, as well as previous and current medications, lab results, immunization and allergies for my entire family.  The initial setup takes a few minutes as you need to register each patient portal for your family.
