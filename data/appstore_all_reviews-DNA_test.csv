You should definitely try this! Iâ€™ve heard of many successful stories and so of my friends have tried this and are very happy with their results.  This app is user-friendly, and in my opinion, is more convenient than using the website on my phone. I have read that this app doesnâ€™t work for other non-Apple phones, and I hope that issue gets fixed.   It is obvious that the 23andMe scientists are very dedicated to learning more about genes and DNA in individuals and in people as a whole. This app gives you the option to answer short survey questions that can further DNA research, which I think will definitely benefit many. I strongly encourage you to fill out the surveys to contribute to research!  Thank you 23andMe for providing an easy way to get ancestry and medical DNA results!",2019-01-09T18:24:11-07:00

There is no in-app messaging feature (so connecting/staying connected with DNA relatives is difficult). If you message a relative and they message you back, if the app doesn’t notify you that they responded (and it doesn’t always), you won’t know that person has messaged you unless you circumnavigate the labyrinth of features back to that particular user’s DNA profile. Another one of the biggest failures of this app is that it does not orient based on how you’re holding your mobile device. It only works if you’re holding your mobile device upright. So if you are using a tablet on its side, the app doesn’t adjust to that orientation. Overall, all it really does is passively allow you to absorb colorful information with your mobile device when you’re holding said device in an upright orientation.

I grew up not knowing who my dad was. My mom was up front with me about what happened back in 1964 and she had an idea of who it was but wasnâ€™t positive. Taking this DNA test confirmed who he was. Iâ€™ve since been in touch with a cousin 23andMe matched me with and was able to get pics of my grandmother and great grandmother on my dadâ€™s side. It was very exciting! Her dad was my dadâ€™s cousin. Unfortunately, he lost all the pics he had of them in a flood. I looked for my dad and discovered he passed away back in 1994 so that was disappointing. I would have loved to know more about him. My mom passed before I took this test and she would have been so happy to know I found family.

And now with the second attempt I am completely discouraged with this entire experience.  I was really looking forward to finding out more about myself through genetic testing, but it is not meant to be.  Perhaps I will try through another competing service and actually find out if it’s my problem or theirs.

The reason the health survey profile questions do not speak with voiceover and the paragraphs do not speak either.  Iâ€™ve already read one unuseable review on this app and I didnâ€™t write that one.  Accessibility improvements are needed here and some programmer will hae to audit this app with voiceover turned on to find all of the errors.

For the most part this is delivered on the iPhone, but opening that same app at double-pixels on an iPad is disappointing.  Also, the data visualizations couldâ€™ve been delivered with a bit more pizzazz. The newer iPhones and especially iPads have processors that can render 3-D graphics and data visualizations. Taking this a step further, the app developer could make the visualizations interactive, especially considering the touchscreen nature of mobile devices.   In summary, the service is cool & interesting and the app manages to display your data to you in a fine enough manner along with unobtrusive tutorials, questionnaires, FAQ, and other helpful things. I reserved the fifth star from this review bc they really should have a native app for the iPad, and the data visualizations should shine a bit more with Appleâ€™s faster processors in the later iOS device generations.",2018-05-22T12:07:01-07:00

There is no in-app messaging feature (so connecting/staying connected with DNA relatives is difficult). If you message a relative and they message you back, if the app doesnâ€™t notify you that they responded (and it doesnâ€™t always), you wonâ€™t know that person has messaged you unless you circumnavigate the labyrinth of features back to that particular userâ€™s DNA profile. Another one of the biggest failures of this app is that it does not orient based on how youâ€™re holding your mobile device. It only works if youâ€™re holding your mobile device upright. So if you are using a tablet on its side, the app doesnâ€™t adjust to that orientation. Overall, all it really does is passively allow you to absorb colorful information with your mobile device when youâ€™re holding said device in an upright orientation. Donâ€™t expect to be able to interact with the application or actively use any of the information with it.",2018-12-28T20:47:00-07:00

I seem to be one of the unlucky few that has very little DNA to be sampled from my saliva.  On both attempts to submit samples I expressly followed the directions; in fact I did it first thing in the morning after waking up.  Not only did the first attempt take forever to actually get to the destination for testing, I had to wait forever to actually find out that it failed.  And now with the second attempt I am completely discouraged with this entire experience.  I was really looking forward to finding out more about myself through genetic testing, but it is not meant to be.  Perhaps I will try through another competing service and actually find out if itâ€™s my problem or theirs.  I also find the lack of direct customer service contact through the app a huge disappointment, and canâ€™t help to wonder if itâ€™s because they want to put the blame on the participants instead of their services.
