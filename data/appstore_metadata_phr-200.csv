A multi-profile application, iBlueButton lets you manage your own health records and that of your loved ones who you are helping manage their care.   • Life and Cost Saving - On average every year, a Medicare beneficiary sees seven different physicians in four different locations, and most of the time anyone of these physicians don’t have a view of the full medical history of their patients, which can be the cause of medical errors, unnecessary tests, and avoidable healthcare expenses. Veterans and military personnel & their families experience the same healthcare issues, as their care takes place in VA / military health facilities, and the private sector. iBlueButton helps you prevent dangerous medical errors by delivering anytime-anywhere access to your list of current medications, diagnoses, and medical history, along with contact information for your physicians and family caregivers. iBlueButton reduces unnecessary costly or redundant tests, imaging services, and procedures by sharing your past tests and procedures with your doctors.   • All in Your Hands - iBlueButton pulls and organizes all records in a Summary Record, with all critical information in easy to view sections for medications, conditions, immunizations and allergies.  • You in Control - iBlueButton gives you control over your health records or that of your loved ones.
