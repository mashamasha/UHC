After spending hours checking I found out that you need an iPhone 8 or 10 and that is ridiculous, it had been working for three years just fine and I can guarantee you that regular hard-working people cannot afford the latest phones. This is a terrible new system which excludes The majority of regular people with regular phones. I am a transplant patient and I need to keep up with my blood work results frequently since many levels such as my potassium could cause me heart problems from one week to another.

No summary view of health stats

In the end, I'm not sure what this is supposed to be. It's far too buggy and the certificate warning doesn't feel at all ""vault""-like and the UI doesn't remotely compete with Fitbit's or Apple's health apps. 

I'm still unclear how I'm supposed to use this. Is this for fitness tracking, as hinted by the list of apps it ties into? If so, why can't I track explicitly within the app? 

Is it for sharing medical information with my doctor? It seems to have the relevant data, but no clear way to do it. 

This seems like a solution looking for a problem, but the solution itself is problematic.

I love what has been started... really! I have ongoing health issues, that keep me in the medical system frequently. 

Currently, where it help most is keeping a current medication list. Then, I can easily print a copy for my wife, in case of emergency. And run off copies when I'm going to the doctor, so I don't have to write it all down, or verbally go over it. They love it! 

Medication History, being one of the most frequently used features, is also the weakest feature, at least that I'm aware of, in the iOS version. It shows you EVERYTHING YOU'VE EVER ENTERED, with no way to filter it to the current melds. If they aren't going to allow filtering at this time, they should at least make the only available display be CURRENT mess only. Then it would be helpful.

The whole mobile app needs to be tossed, and a team that knows how to design data-driven mobile sites, should help a great UI designer start with a blank sheet. There is nothing in the old one id want to salvage, nor would I want to tether them with the old code. 

The HV website has gotten enough traction that several of the health / exercise-related IoT devices, will automatically update HV from their own update site. THAT'S how things should work! And it was super easy to set-up. I had my FitBit, and Withings device talking together with MyFitnessPal in no time. So, let's build on the good...

HV needs to be proactive in writing connections to the major EMR systems (both clinical, and hospital), lab systems, radiology systems, and pharmacy management systems. If the took the top three players in each category, and wrote import connections from the healthcare provider-side into HV, probably 80% of all our medical records could be imported directly from the provider's system. This would be incredible, compared to hand-input, or scanning in information.

I could go on and on with ideas on where to go with HealthVault...but they haven't asked me. ğŸ˜�

Two gotchas at this point (01/08/2018) with version 2.0.1 (iPad): a) no direct contact with any application support personnel, b) Dropbox and local network HTTP functionality doesn’t appear to work. Use of Dropbox pops up authorization window but no backup is ever performed (screen blinks after allowing access and then drops back to Capzule). Initiating local network transfer fails as Capzule never opens up the designated port.

b) HTTP connectivity: issue resolved - desktop multi-network control sequence

Very useful & largely functional. But one concern is always, how to make sure your info is secure beyond just living on your phone? 

I like to backup to a separate iPad when possible using Dropbox. That quit working a few weeks ago. The developer released an upgrade that was supposed to fix that. But now when I try the backup, I get sent to my Dropbox app to approve Capzule’s access. When I click to Allow, I get sent right back to the Capzule app with no backup happening. Try the backup again, get sent back to Dropbox again to allow access. OVER AND OVER. Something is not communicating right between those two. Please help!

Edit to add: developer contacted me, I can’t respond by e-mail or on their website though - only though the App Store on my phone, which I hate. Anyway: tried closing and launching both apps in various orders, same result. Deleted Dropbox & re-installed it, same result. Tap settings -> cloud symbol under Backup -> Dropbox; Dropbox launches and says “Capzule PHR Free would like access to files & folders in your Dropbox” -> tapping Allow causes the “Authorizing” box to momentarily appear, then Capzule reopens to the account page and the News folder flashes blue two times... but the only message in the folder is the Version 2.0.1 announcement.

My Medical,347860026,Wonderful App!!!,voxfugit,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id104186093,0.0,0.0,5,"As of July 2017, I am into my sixth year with this app. It is still in essential in my opinion and does exactly what they say it will do. I am confused by those Who have given the app low ratings. My only experience with support has been outstanding. This app is all I need now when I go into a doctors office for the first time. Doctors love the thoroughness and emergency medical personnel or even more impressed.  I have had to use the app in emergency and regular doctor visit situations so I know where of I speak.  And no I am not related to the developer!

[Original review]

Has a wonderful variety of options to input everything you need to remember.  I have been carryinging a medical history for a year now on paper.  This has me ready to give up the paper and just carry my phone with a medical symbol sticker on the case.  I especially like the web site this app allows you to use to enable easier loading of data.  My only suggestion would be to add an ability to mark certain pills and doctors to appear in groupings for specific chronic treatment issues rather than to have to check all areas for what might otherwise be referenced through a special sub folder on diabetes for example.  I have already shared this app with one of my doctors and he loved it. 

Been using for over a year now and still love it!!  I have used it when visiting new doctors and checking into the hospital.  They have all been most impressed with how organized I am.  I tell everyone I meet who has a complex medical history or parents they assist or children whose immunizations they need to track about this app.  Best money I ever spent in the app store!

I've now been using this app for three years and still consider it the best money I ever spent on an app. There have been some issues along the way. So before turning on or off synching or such, be sure to back up data. The one time I needed to use it, it worked like a charm. Still highly recommended.",2017-07-21 02:14:19

I am so incredibly mad at the creative tech genius who caused this failure. Yes, I should have taken more time to figure out a good way to back up the info (it used to update my Mac version but stopped when the iCloud connection ended), but given that I'm not the only one experiencing this lost, I am blaming the tech people.

I wanted an app that was less than a year old. Well this one was made in Dec 2015, but the things this app can do. 
It's a journal and it's a pain to enter all the information required. But once everything is updated you only have to sit back and have your Medical history at your finger tips.

This app does all that. Not surprisingly, the actual data entry is a pain, but that has nothing to do with the app. Finding all those pill bottles, blood tests, etc is necessary for this to work properly. (You can enter data from your address book effortlessly) But once the data is in, sharing and/or updating becomes easy. This is a smart app, in that it anticipates from already entered data what you may need when updating. I bought the iPad app to enter and keep the data up to date, and the iPhone app for ease of use and portability when visiting the doctor. Yes, you need to buy each. But syncing is easy. Once you're at a medical office, if you wold rather not narrate a record, you can just email it straight from the app to the medical office. In a couple of seconds, they have your info. 
BTW, support is great. I had a problem - turns out it was a user issue, not the app - and I had a support email back in a few hours with the correct solution.

My Medical,347860026,Great app.,---appaddict---,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id212582172,0.0,0.0,4,"This is the only medical information app I've kept. I've tried others, but only My Medical remains in use.

Fast, easy importing of notes, documents, photos. I import entries from DayOne when needed & have many lab reports I've scanned using the phone. I have all of my medically related photos in the app & it remained perfectly intact when I switched to a new phone. I wish all my other apps were as stable.

I have a good deal of information stored here so I really appreciate the fast navigation. If I need something during a doctor's appointment, I can find what I need in a few seconds & the doctors really appreciate that. It's very useful, has a clean, updated look & I'd recommend it to anyone.

I removed one star because there's not much in the way of linking information to each specific doctor or prescription - that would make it near perfect. However, that's never slowed things down when I needed it to perform at the last minute.",2015-06-06 16:18:42

One if it's nice features is (was) that it automatically enters office visits in my calendar through iCloud. Now, they're changing to DropBox so I will be changing to another app. If you are a fan of DropBox and aren't concerned by its security issues, this is a very useful app. If you're an iOS device user, not so much. You might want to keep looking. The one technical design change that I would recommend is the ability to easily move prescriptions from current to old status. Otherwise, it's a great way to track and record your medical information.
Update:
There is now a way to change the status of prescriptions from current to old. No problem. They keep saying that iCloud synch is going to be taken away but haven't done it so far, so I'll keep using it. If not for the iCloud vs. Dropbox issue, I would give this app 5 stars.

Especially considering what's at stake (one's health). 
This was the first sort of expensive premium app i ever purchased. 
I purchased two; one for my mac, one for my iPhone, 
with the  simple idea that they would communicate with each other.
 
i needed to go see my cardiologist this Monday morning armed with the proper information. 
I spent weeks and weeks collecting all my health data I needed to have prepared for him. 
I had an issue with the syncing; I'm using dropbox but the units weren't speak to each other.
I wrote to support asking for some advice on how to get the two apps to communicate; no response,
wait a couple days, ask again, nothing.

it's been 10 days now, and all i receive from them is the ""acknowledgment of your email"" response.

for those of you who are syncing properly, it appears to be a useful app,
but if you have even a small hiccup, consider this fair warning.

 Two suggestions that I'd like to see. The first one is searchability, it would be nice to search a term, or search for a doctor, or search for something you know has been filed, you're just not sure where it was filed.
My second suggestion would be:  When adding information such as blood pressure in test and procedures, it would be nice if we could have that test with our default unit. 
For example- Currently when adding blood-pressure I have to go and add the number then I have to click on units and find mmHg. It would be so much easier if I could set mmHg as my standard for this input. Another example would be heart rate, having to select bpm, slows down the input of information.

I like the way I can keep all my documents in one place. Navigation is rough in places and it's not perfect.

I don't like the fact you have to buy a version for the iphone/ipod and yet another for the ipad. They're sort of an expensive app and if it was universal, it would be worth it. But I'm not convinced having it on all devices and buying it fo each one is worth it at all. It's not an app you're likely to use daily or even weekly or monthly unless you doctor a lot.

Many doctors now put records online for their patients. So one might question the need for an app like this. But, for now at least, I think it's nice to have on at least one of your devices.",2013-10-19 05:10:54

My Medical,347860026,Nearly Perfect PHR App,Lesley11,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id35101960,0.0,0.0,4,"I have this app on the Mac, iPhone, and iPad.  It is a very powerful app with significant functionality.  It allows you to enter and track your diagnoses, meds, test results, vitals, appointments, etc.  It accesses your contacts and calendar, so you can enter your office visits once and have them appear in your calendar.  It also has the functionality for you to track multiple people within your family, so is great for those of us dealing with aging parents and/or children.

Two things would make this a five star app.  Medication reminders and a better syncing solution.  While the app lets you enter all your meds and reminds you when to fulfill a prescription, it doesn't have notifications of when you are supposed to take your meds each day.  I still have to use a separate app for that.

In terms of syncing, I understand that iCloud was problematic.  However, the Mac version allows you to store your data on Dropbox.  I don't understand why the iOS versions also don't let you access that data from Dropbox, which would keep everything seamlessly in sync.  The current ""send/receive over the same WiFi network"" functionality is clunky and runs the risk of having data loss.",2013-07-03 02:28:09

I think it's a good app.  I've looked into several, but this one keeps coming up.  Now I have several medical problems that require me to take the time.  

I have a few suggestions:
1.  Many doctors have several location, but you can only add one address.  I have more than one doctor that practices at multiple locations.
2.  Several of the doctors have more than one phone number. I just recently had problems getting in touch with a doctor only to find out that their phone was out of order.  I called the hospital and got another number.  When the phone was repaired, then I went back to using the original number.  But, the other number is still good.  Although this was a minor incident, I think it's a good idea.  Plus, what about cell numbers?

also, no easy way to input lab results or monitor BP.  The office visit section is also weird. It would be nice to keep a record of office visits already completed, ..but with this app, ones that are already finished are in with the ones that are in the future.  Really annoying.  The reminders for those appointments only go back two days. Many of my appointments are for next year...mammograms, annual physicals, and are not able to be made yet. It would be nice to have a reminder about these three months in advance so that I can call for the appointments. Many doctor offices do not make appointments a year in advance and you have to remember to do it at a later date.  Having a reminder two days before isn't helpful.

I also like how the app looks just like the iPhone’s own apps, for instance the Contacts app.  It has the same look and same way of inputting my info. There's no learning curve to use this app, no clutter, no confusion. I keep extensive records in some sections and as little as I need in other.

My Medical,347860026,Bugs Galore,TheatrePatron,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id175307849,0.0,0.0,3,"This app has the potential to be the best medical app I've ever seen.  But there are some bugs.  

Bug # 1, if you choose to use iCloud sync…which ever app you turn icloud on last is what will be uploaded to the cloud.  For example, I purchased all three apps, the Mac, iPhone, & iPad versions.  So using the Mac I input my extensive medical history into the program.  Then I setup the app on my iPhone and iMac.  Rather than iCloud  uploading the info I just put into the system, it uploaded the blank data from the newly opened app to the iCloud and deleted everything I put into my Mac app.  
Bug # 2, I then tried to backup the app using a Continuality Care Report.  Every time I hit backup on my Mac, it locks the program up.  I can't input any data, I can't even close the app.  It is perpetually locked until I reboot my computer.  But oh wait…it won't let me do that either because the program won't close.  So basically you have to hard reboot your computer to unlock the program.

Now, lets go over the good things.  Once you get done with the trial and error of it, it works flawlessly.  (besides the lockup described above)  It syncs, and it does the ability to save any files in the app itself.  No need to keep redundant copies on your computer (be warned though) I wouldn't delete any files you have on your computer until the bugs are worked out).",2012-07-06 15:54:57
My Medical,347860026,Good for Meds,JA.Macko,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id42280346,1.0,1.0,2,"Keeping track of all your medical information as you get older is tedious and hard work.  If you enjoy that hard work, this app can help you, as it will lose your information on a regular basis, and you will have to re-enter it over and over.  Customer Service has informed me that this doesn't happen, it must be something I am doing wrong. Maybe.

If you have family members you can add their info as well, by making multiple profiles.   You can email yourself a back up.  You can also email a copy of the date you have enter so you can print it out for your doctor, which is very handy.    

A new feature in this version is iCloud; There is basically no help on this, the help is basic and only  shows you how to turn it on, it has no troubleshooting on how to get it to sync, when it will not sync; and customer service will not help unless you can pin point your question on how it's not working or not sync'n.  My Medical has a web site you can visit, has forms and a help page.

Entering medical information on the My Medical app can be done with your computer,  but can not be edited on your computer.  (so you will need to start over each time)

Lab Tests & Procedures-This feature is particularly un-helpful.  I have not found any doctor office that transfers this info like x-rays or labs.  You must have them and enter them yourself.   So If you do not save copies of medical info from various doctors, you will  not have the info to put in My Medical app.

1. When printing or making a pdf, it would be nice to choose which categories I wanted included. Sometimes I just want medications and allergies and nothing else, but it prints out everything which ends up being pages to sift through. 

2. Also, when printing or making a pdf, I wish it would organize the info into a spreadsheet. This makes it much easier for a doctor to review. 

3. Finally, I wish there was an online cloud version (like evernote or ireminder) so that my mom could add info from her computer and have it show up on my computer.

I find it easy to figure out, have gotten compliments from my NP about it, and find it pretty thorough. Love being able to email reports to doctors. 
I have some suggestions also. 
1. When previous entries are offered as a choice, it would be easier if the blank entry box showed up at the top instead of at the bottom.
2. It would be helpful if a list of family were available to choose from for filling out Family History--often they will be the same for everybody. This would mean needing a way to identify the relative by a name and being able to change the relationship (i.e. my husband's sister is also my children's paternal aunt).

3. I am hoping that someday you will add features like charts that will show things like blood pressure over time, or separate apps that could track the info but allow the results to be integrated into the main app for reports, etc.

My Medical,347860026,"Good, but could be much better",TexJoeB,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id48867153,0.0,0.0,2,"Hope the developers read this. 

I have been looking like an app like this for a while, and although I was hesitant to purchase an app I couldn't try for free first I went ahead and purchased it.

The good it does what it says. What could be better?

Here's my suggestions:
Medications - many apps will let you pick from a list, which includes interactions, side effects, pill identification marks & even pictures. With this app you have to type in all the info yourself, no additional drug info, and you have to find & save (or take a picture of the pill) and add it yourself.

Vaccinations:
Everytime you add a vaccination the app adds a block. It would be better to have one block per vaccination, that shows the latest record & when you click on the box it opens to records for that vaccine, ie 1 box for polio, not 5.

Tests: would like to be able to add individual portions of tests & select which ones to compare ie WBC, without having to uncheck all the filters, only way to currently do this is enter it separately. This would also help when a dr only runs a portion of the test. For example glucose is included in CMP, but when dr only ran glucose, if i only entered it as glucose, it won't show up in the chart.

Switch to number pad option for entering blood work test results, also no need to open in a new window, just makes entering data slower.

Don't need to be able to see all results when I open window, CBC boxes are long and takes a while to scroll through info. Try accordion style.

Also, there is no way to put in a reference range in on blood work, which would be helpful.

A few final suggestions: add ER visits, not the same as hospitalizations; add selection tool for surgeries, why do I need a box to type in tonsillectomy; lab tests & imaging should be separated, also add facility location option for labs and imaging, blood work ran in ER may be ran by a different lab than a doctors office & X-rays & scans may be done by someone outside your PCP.

That's all for now, I will re-evaluate as the app is updated.",2012-05-05 18:02:35

2). I took the time to enter 15 years of test results for a couple things that are important for me to track.  I love being able to see a graph of the data but would like it even more if I could select a date range for the graph.. ie 2008-present.   
I really love this app overall and if you take the time to enter data it is so helpful as I always have my phone with me, wherever I go!
Thanks for making a great app!",2012-04-29 07:11:56

My Medical,347860026,AMAZING Lifesaver,SFC @rcher,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id40243333,1.0,1.0,4,"I have used this app since its release because of my health issues.  I am a disabled veteran and have many health issues that would be a nightmare to track if not for this app.  I am able to schedule all of my Dr. Appts, Lab Appts and keep track of everything.  I also have to track 11 prescriptions plus those that I have been removed from and thanks to this app, I just email a list to the Dr. before each appt.  I am also able to keep all of my blood work and keep track of improvements and failures on the heart disease side of life.

One of the other great aspects to this app is that it is very easy to enter data and then back it up straight to my own email.  My info stays with me and is not stored with someone else in the world...THANKS GUYS!!!  Once backed up in multiple places/ways...it is easliy recoverable and puts me right back to where I was.  Customer Service is OUTSTANDING...a reply to any email happens in less then 2 hours based on my multiple questions/issues over the years.  I have ALWAYS had my question or issue resolved usually within the same day!

Lastly I would recommend two things...Change the App Icon...it is ugly and does not draw attention to medical personnel that there is important info available in a medical emergency.  The current icon makes it look like a ""To Do"" / ""Task"" List and not a medical information app.  I would also recommend that if a person where in a medical emergency situation that they could open the app, hit a button that would dial 911 and provide a gps location to the dispatcher.  In this way, the app would be open and if the patient became unconsious then rescue would be on the way and the app would already be open when they arrived.

Otherwise, I HIGHLY recommend this app and will change my 4 stars to 5 when/if my recommendations are added.  Great App Guys!!!",2012-03-21 15:34:44

My Medical,347860026,The best of the pick,marksealey,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id11020526,0.0,0.0,5,"Spent a lot of time researching the various Apps that will allow you easily to enter your medical data/history - ideally away from the iPhone itself (too much tiny typing!) - and have it all instantly and simply available, well-arranged yet secure.

My Medical seemed the best… comprehensive; good reviews with respect to its stability; appealing interface; ease of use and so on.

It became obvious within less than five minutes that such other reviews were accurate.

The system of being able to copy and paste text etc into a form on the developer's website (which then emails My Medical owners a link via an iPhone mail account - click it and data is entered faultlessly into the App) was particularly appealing.

Further, the App really does allow you to commit a usefully rich range of medical data - and for multiple users, family members, those one cares for etc.

Support from the developer is quick, helpful and friendly.

There certainly appears to be no other App so comprehensive, easy to use, reliable and well-supported as My Medical. Excellent value!",2011-11-27 16:21:24

1)  The current medications should be easy to transfer into the past medications area without having to enter all the information all over again.  I have not found a way to do this and it should be easy to do.

It may sound crazy, but it's important to have their information like anyone else's.

The second thing that sets the My Medical app apart from any other is the way it is organized. The layout is simply wonderful and wonderfully simple. There is nothing to learn. Everything is in precisely the right place and at the same time, it seems to include everything I could possibly need. And that is no simple feat. I've tried other apps like this and they either don't do enough or they're utterly impossible to use. I love that I can list my meds separately from my previous history.

I have one suggestion for now.  The app is mostly great with merging in new data you enter using the website, but there is a problem with resolving conflicts.  If you happened to slightly change an entry both on your phone and in the web interface, the app doesn't let you know, or prompt you to resolve the conflict, it just creates two records that are slightly different.

My Medical,347860026,Is it really this good? YES,harringg,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id35009747,1.0,1.0,5,"I've been tracking these vitals in a combination of Excel, Access and Word, BP tracking apps, etc...  This app has it all in one place.  I really like the feature that if entering multiple meds, the Prescription information, once entered in Current Medications, is just a click away for repeat entries (ie. same pharmacy).  Makes data entry quick and easy.  Graphs are easy to read, emailed reports are very logically organized and readable (not just a raw data-dump of the information).  If you need to track yours or family members vitals, this is the app to get!  This app alone saved me money on several stand-alone (specific to a given vital record) tracking apps I was looking at.

Password protection is important and I like the fact that even when it's locked, if someone finds you and your phone, they can access the Emergency contact information without a password.

4 stars because I would like to see it lock on exit (unless it's an iPhone 4 multitask thing I haven't figured out yet).  I have to quit using the double-click and minus, otherwise everytime I just return the home screen and come back it's still unlocked.

Edit: I just changed to 5 Stars because I just discovered you can email yourself a backup should something happen the phone or the data file.  Crucial for an app of this type.",2011-02-09 05:34:43

Charting is a nice feature as well.

I had a small hiccup with pharmacy phone numbers.  When I would attempt to add a pharmacy phone number to prescriptions I was faced with a list of six numbers and could not figure out which number was for which pharmacy.  Then I re-entered all the info with the number first and name following it so I could choose the appropriate number.

I needed somewhere to enter an expiration date for prescriptions and e-mailed Steven, the developer.  I received a reply within a few hours and found out that it is already in the works for the next update!  Also an alert for upcoming expiration dates is coming.  Six stars!

My Medical,347860026,Fab App!,cenlahomes,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id131630592,2.0,2.0,5,"Wonderful app and certainly more convenient than taking ziplock bags of meds to each dr appt! Email and txt views are also an added plus for sending to providers, and who could complain about the email backup option?  I've had the app for a few hours now and have finally finished filling everything in.  The photo ID for each patient prevents emergency workers from applying the wrong patient info to the wrong person, which is another plus.  Additionally, I'm glad the info isn't stored on servers anywhere (preserving strict privacy) and doesn't require wi-fi to access. 

A very minor bug I found:

- When ""view information as text"" or ""send info by email"" options are selected, emergency contacts' phone number is shown as ""PrimaryTelForNumber"" rather than the actual number. I would correct to show actual telephone numbers.

I might not have noticed had it not been part of MyMedical. 
It is the best and most used APP I have. As ratings go, I rarely give out 4 stars and I've never given 5 until now. 

• It is easy to use either on your device or on your PC. 
• When you have questions ASK. 
• When you have input, GIVE. 
• There is a real person at the other end who listens and responds. 
• The APP is continually improving and becoming more robust. 

Very impressive. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS APP TO THE FOLLOW PEOPLE:
1: Would like to track their own medical information (especially those like me who see 6 specialists a week and can't keep up with meds)
2: Anyone with achool age children. Keeping track of vaccinations, their last visit to the dentist, and eye doctor.  
3: Anyone who cares for an elderly person (parent, grandparent): keep their information handy; their doctors information, Medications RX #s, Pharmacy, dosage, schedule, last time it was filled, allergy alerts, insurance/Medicare info, etc. 
4: Anyone interested in collecting their Family Medical History. It's important to ask everyone now, more important to document it and MOST important to consistantly update and distribute.",2010-03-05 15:20:06

I would also like to graph my weight and blood pressure readings and be able to send them to my doctor. I have to use two other apps to do this. Would be nice if one app would handle all of this.

There is no way any practice using this App with Greenway EMR should be meeting Meaningful Use requirements from the government.

As a patient I have several portal apps and this is by far the worst.  I have now deleted the app for fear it does more harm than good PLUS the app is so non-functional that the staff suggest I need to log in with a full computer if I want to message my doctor.

As an EMR Professional I am scared for any providers office that uses this technology.   It DOES NOT meet Meaningful Use and the government needs to be made aware.

How anyone could write a great review WITHOUT submitting their name is ridiculous. All the positive reviews have to have been made by employees.

Had a monthly challenge and a website where you could get a small coupon or donate your 'watts' (basically points earned for 'steps' you've done)to one of two charities. Simple and easy!! NOW, I wouldn't recommend this app to my worst enemy!! Omg, mostly 'spam' when opens up as it goes on about the new communities they want to expand on, talks about the two they have, asks trivia, asks how you doing, blah, blah, blah. The challenge is still there, only they now also do extra ones for each community so who knows if anyone is actually in the community for what the community is there for or just for the chance at a gift card. This makes these communities almost worthless to connect to others in the same situation as you, which may be why you joined. The metrics are now last, and they will even ask 'what do you use the app for' if you email them about this horrible update!! Even if this is free, just NO! My recommendation is keep eye out for the stations & use them plus a small notebook to keep track of your own blood pressure & weight. If you can't find one then, and only then, download app to find a station. Just be aware that it's up to you to notice if the station is working correctly on top of everything else.

The insights from the higi station have helped me understand my body better and improve my lifestyle all along my 45Lb weight loss journey. As a daily user, I wish a few things were different about my experience: 

1. I do not feel comfortable entering my login information in a public place. I could previously scan a QR code and only had to log in on my phone. 

2. I do not feel comfortable entering my date of birth in public. Is Age not a sufficient input? 

3. I wish the phone app would atleast remember my user name if security is a concern. Frankly security isn't a concern for me since my phone needs a pass code. Almost everybody used a pass code these days! I wish it atleast had an option to ""remember my password"".

4. I wish the Higi app would share data with the IOS health app. It's a widely compatible health tracking platform that has become wildly popular for the same reason. My fitbit app works that way. This makes it so much more convenient to see all my data in one place. Will it reduce my time spent on the Higi app? Yes it will. If the intention is to build a future channel to monetize on ads, I don't really read the articles on the app since they aren't really focused on my goals- maybe another improvement opportunity. 

After thrashing the hard workers on the Higi team with my last comment, here's some food for thought to lighten up the mood- what if Higi worked with insurance companies to collect lab test results and bring it to my phone's health app? Now, that's something insurance companies would pay for. A lot of insurance plans offer free Fitbits to keep people health and thus reduce their risks. I feel Higi can step into the league if they make their case well.

My health achievements are one of many out there, ready to be cited. 

Keep up the great job, don't disappoint. Your users are watching you!",2016-06-15 17:34:45

Beyond my objections to  the very premise of this app, the functionality is horrible.  It inaccurately tracks responses, doesnâ€™t tell you when an earning window begins and ends and is otherwise very ineffective.  When you experience a problem, you have to contact customer service via email and good luck getting a salient response.

1. I am 36 years old not 76.  I donâ€™t take my BP everyday. I donâ€™t check my glucose everyday.  I didnâ€™t check my cholesterol everyday. I do those things once a year unless otherwise directed by a physician. The app actually showed my â€œrealâ€� age as 34 so why do I need to do these things for the app everyday?
2. Why doesnâ€™t it give you the option of syncing to another device than your phone? I keep my Fitbit with me more than my phone. I have tiny pockets and canâ€™t fit my phone in my pocket while working because of that. I do however keep my Fitbit in my pocket. 
3. If this is really supposed to track health why isnâ€™t there a female reproductive tracking system in place? Lots of women suffer from early signs of reproductive issues that worsen because they donâ€™t see the overall progress of the issues due to improper tracking.
Anyways Iâ€™m deleting because I already have a similar app thatâ€™s better. Hopefully one day my company will cut some type of deal with Fitbit and Iâ€™ll just be able to use the app I like.",2018-07-14 09:47:56

- The UI design is horrible; for a consumer app, Aetna being one of the big insurance companies with millions of customers should have invested more in UI/UX design.Irregular font sizes, boring color themes make this app very unwelcoming to use
- Performance is pretty bad. Looks like the developers stuffed a web app with a native container. Takes forever to load.
- Touch ID doesn’t work consistently. I understand security is very important in regulated industry but when my local community bank has an awesome app that is secure, I don’t see why a big insurance company can have one that works.
- Search is slow!
- The ID card aspect ratio is not correctly calculated. Even their own logo is stretched in some cases. Not sure if someone from marketing approved this.

If I go online at least my web browser will remember my username and password. 

Another issue...I requested a refill on a prescription. It took my credit card number and seemed to work just fine, but then nothing actually processed. You don’t get any kind of email or notification that it went through. The order history says it takes 48 hours from the time your doctor sends in the prescription to update. So it took days before I realized that my prescription had not actually been processed. It would be nice if they had more timely order histories so you could see immediately that your request had gone through.

My only issue so far is that it doesnâ€™t specifically show me where to go for an appointment...

For example, I have an appointment at 6:30am at the Fontana location in Radiology to get scanned. I can see on the appointment page the location with regards to the hospitalâ€™s address, but the hospital is divided into 4 buildings, 1,2,3 and their overnight building. Plus the outlying speciality buildings. There happen to be 4 Radiology units here. So if I have an appointment in building 3 on the basement level in Radiology, but show up to the 3rd floor Radiology unit in building 2 it might make me very late. I have good mobility, imagine if someone with poor mobility faced the same issue.

My suggestion, add the specific building and maybe the floor needed for checking in to the â€œlocationâ€� portion of the appointment page.",2018-08-22 06:53:47

Kaiser Permanente,493390354,App about as good as southern cal Kaiser care,lrk782,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id137902545,0.0,0.0,1,"My biggest pet peeve about this stupid app (same goes for your website) is your pharmacy system. It could be so convenient, if it were accurate and worked. There have been numerous times when it says my prescriptions are available for refill (meaning it's not on the list that says it's too early for a refill and won't allow you to even try) that I've requested a refill, and not only has my physician authorized the refill and the pharmacy I'm to pick it up at notified me it was ready for pick up, and I've taken the bus (I can't drive due to medical condition) all the way to the pharmacy only to get there and find out ""oh sorry it's too early to refill that prescription"". I get it, with the prescription drug abuse epidemic you have to be careful and strict and I'm fine with following any and all rules regarding that. But you need to link your website and app with your pharmacy rules so that people aren't told via the app it's okay to request a refill and their doctor okay that refill and the pharmacy tells you come pick it up, then you waste your time because when you do, oops sorry too soon. That's so ridiculous. And honestly 3 days before a medication you take daily is due to run out is when patients can request a refill? 3 days? It takes 3 days or longer just to get your doctors approval most times and then another 2 for it to be filled. I've run out of medications I take daily too many times because of this ""rule"" and I say ""rule"" because you never know if the pharmacist who is working follows that rule or not. Some do, some will fill a three month prescription a month early or a one month prescription 10 days early. At least be consistent so patients aren't suddenly told of a rule that supposedly isn't new but in the 13 years I've had kaiser insurance has never been enforced until recently. When I ask if it's new, nope, always been the rule. Huh, then you've got a whole lot of staff who don't follow your rules and that's an issue. The ""past visit"" info is a joke (it literally tells you nothing other than the date of your past visit) and the ""medical history"" is also a joke since it tells you any chronic illnesses you have (great thanks didn't know that already) and what medications you take (and never updates so apparently I've been on antibiotics for years now). 99% of appts you'd make you have to call to make anyways so the appt part is mostly useless as well. So all in all if you want to know where a Kaiser facility is located or need to email your doctor (which is the only reason I gave a star, this feature is useful, as long as your doctor actually checks and responds which 2 of mine do amazingly, and one takes several months to hear back if I do, but not the apps fault) then this app might work for you.

What would really be nice is the ability to self report health data like weight, BP, blood sugar levels, cholesterol levels and so on.  Iâ€™m trying to lose weight so I periodically weigh myself. Instead of some other app why canâ€™t I keep that data here?  I go to the Stanford blood bank and they compute my cholesterol level and take my BP.  Why canâ€™t I keep that data here?

The data I enter could be tagged as â€œself reportedâ€� so a medical provider would know if the data was my measurement or if it was taken by a professional. 

Providing this capability could be a plus in a patientâ€™s health care.  Imagine an overweight patient with a blood sugar and cholesterol problem. Instead of only having data points from when they see a Kaiser professional (primary physician, physicianâ€™s assistant, nurse, dietician, etc) the health provider has as much data as possible.  This could help reveal trends in health related behavior and thus better allow the provider to tailor treatment. 

Mobile computing could take health care to another level but health care providers like Kaiser are only scratching the surface.  Hopefully someone at Kaiser will see these comments and will consider the enhancements I have suggested above.",2017-11-25 04:32:44

After several days of abdominal pain I went to see a primary care physician (not my regular one, he was not available for several weeks). The guy I did see wasn't sure what I had so he put me on antibiotics.  Two weeks later with no improvement and I call to make a urology appointment. The next available appointment is over a month out. The socialized medicine horror stories that you read about from Europe and Canada have now  arrived at our front door.  Now we will all see what free healthcare is all about. 

Original review:
So let's recap.  Premiums tripled, phone hold times between 30-50 minutes, check in lines quadrupled, specialty appointments that used to take a week now take 4-6 weeks to schedule, doctors and nurses leaving in droves and now the app is falling apart.  Thanks for staying in Obamacare, Kaiser, and screwing all of your old patients.  

Can't reply to doctor or nurse information.  OK and Send buttons missing.  Prescription refill problems.  All kinds of glitches that were not there before.  Kaiser is heading downhill fast.  I see various doctors frequently because of my medical issues. They say that workload has increased, seasoned doctors snd nurses are leaving, and they cannot find enough competent talent to backfill the positions. 

Kaiser used to be great.  A few years of Obamacare and it has all been ruined.  Kaiser is one of only two providers still in the GA exchange. All of us long-term patients have really been screwed by their poor decisions.  Skyrocketing premiums with dwindling services.",2017-04-11 10:26:12

Why ask the user if they'd like an appointment within two days then ask for a date range again? The final step is the most aggravating. If the user's specified date range doesn't return an available appointment slot, they have to completely start over.

Kaiser Permanente,493390354,Pretty good for a healthcare provider,Reynard Sheerr,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id40613739,0.0,1.0,4,"Sadly, I am no longer a Kaiser member due to a change in employers (I love Kaiser). Overall, the app is pretty good but not great. It provides access to your future and past appointments with after visit summaries, lab results, immunization records, messages from your doctor, an electronic representation of the membership card and much more.

Some of the functionality just seems to be a web page embedded inside the app, some features look native.

What would make the app delightful, and 5 star worthy, are the seemingly small details and features. Below is my feature wishlist. I know, it's not always easy to make this sort of stuff happen, especially in the healthcare environment where HIPAA compliance and the bureaucracy that comes with it can slow down the easiest tasks. 

1. The app doesn't particularly look great on large screen iPhones.
2. While the electronic membership card is embedded inside the app, it would be even better if Kaiser provided an Apple Wallet membership card.
3. HealthKit integration: I wanted to import my medical record into the Health app. Unfortunately, the app doesn't provide an easy way to do so. I tried to import the health summary XML file that Kaiser provides on its website. Sadly, the Health app was unable to read it.  I have successfully imported HL7 XML files from other providers, so I know it works.
4. Move more of the interface from webviews into native views.",2016-10-02 16:34:35

Fix your bugs, Kaiser!

I am reiterating my original complaint. They will let you choose the pharmacy. They give you a select button with which to select what pharmacy you would like to pick up your prescription at. Then there is no next button. There is no logical way to get onto the next page. There are only three buttons available, none of them The next button, nor any other button to get it onto the next page. The only three buttons available to you after the select your pharmacy to pick up your prescription page is: ""back"", ""cancel"" (I assume that the ""cancel"" Button is essentially the same as the back button in terms of results), and then there is the ""search"" button, with which to search and select the pharmacy from.

My favorite part is that it makes it so easy to review recent claims: I can choose parameters for what I want to review. For example, I can choose to review only medical claims for me in the last 30 days. Or I can review only dental claims for my daughter within the last 90 days. I can further specify only paid claims, or those that were denied, being processed, being appealed, or have been adjusted, etc. I also love that I can ""Live Chat"" if I have a question. 
Three suggestions for improvement: 
1. Make ""Live Chat"" available 24/7 (or see #2)
2. Allow me to send a message/ask a question to be answered by customer service via return message the next day. 
3. Allow me to see status of requests for pre-certification/preauthorization. For example, after my doctor submits a request, I'd like to be able to see if it was received, if it's under review, whether or not the request was approved or denied, and the reason for that decision.

Blue Shield has been unresponsive to my emails regarding this or any other issues. Diagnosis: Coma. 

Addendum: A day after I wrote the above review I discovered that the app won't let me in! Blue Shield must have taken it off life support. Called death of Mr. App at 7:44 am.

A day later while resting in the morgue Mr. App came back to life! It's a miracle! Can now view ID card, view plan summary, view claims, find urgent care and find a provider, but alas he still won't let me pay my monthly premium or transfer to the full site. Maybe in his next reincarnation he will be endowed with these features.

And then behold in the following weeks a transformation of unbelievable dimensions occurred. It was possible to transfer to the main site and pay my premium!

MyHumana,779622024,Great but would benefit from more features!,Kyleidoscope,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id17886006,0.0,0.0,4,"Hello Humana and Dev team,

Your app is solid overall but lacks some key features. Here is some feedback for features I think customers would benefit from:

- Ability to mark claims as Paid, Unpaid. Would also be nice to have a notes section that customers can flag certain bills to set up a personal payment plan with their budgets.
- Filters for the above suggestion i.e. filtering paid, unpaid, you may owe, flagged, noted, last 30/60 days, last 6 months, current year, previous year
- Prescriptions section that lists any drug prescriptions given to patient by care giver. When the prescription was filled, etc.
-The ability to add/view accounts associated with medical bills like HSA, DCFSA, OptiMed accounts, etc.
- Pay in app feature with above suggested accounts through something like Instamed or other comparable companies.
- Integration with smart devices (FitBit, Apple Watch, etc). I envision a simple step tracker that ties to ""feel good"" push notifications and maybe paired with some Humana promotions/rewards.
-Ability to show customers which care providers are in-network vs. out-of-network when using the ""Find Care"" tab. If all are in-network, there should be a message present stating this for better understanding.

Thanks for the current features, looking forward to continued updates and new features to be added for a better customer experience!

Information.  Not what I needed. The APP does not work on an iPhone, I already got all the info from my computer.  Had a question to try to solve at the doctor’s office to show them that Anthem had paid a claim and I knew before they did but the app failed spectacularly.  They were not impressed with the app or with Anthem at that point.  My phone works with my other apps because I thought there might be a problem with it, but no, it is local to Anthem only.  So will delete it again. Guess I should not be surprised since app only has a 1.6 rating. I am glad the insurance is way better than the app.",2018-08-07 13:58:04

First, when I tried to log in, the message said my username or password was incorrect. Fine, maybe I forgot one or the other. Before I could press the link to get my username or reset the password, I got a pop-up saying â€œWeâ€™re here to help.â€�  I had to clear the pop-up at least three time to get the screen to recover my password. After entering all the information, I got an error message. I checked for updates and then updated the app hoping that would solve the problem. Nope, the update didnâ€™t help. 

I finally was able to get a password reset email.  Used the temporary password and tried to log in. Success. I got in and was redirected to a page to reset my password. When I did, I was logged out. So, I tried to log in using my new password, but instead of getting to the main menu (which I could see in the background as the white â€œworkingâ€� dots swirled) I got the exact message we see in the Developer Responses: â€œWeâ€™re here to help.â€� I was then logged out. This happened numerous times. When I finally got logged in, I pressed one blue tile to check my account summary, got the â€œWeâ€™re here to helpâ€� pop-up, and was booted back to the log in screen. 

On my next log in, I got to the main screen and decided to activate the touchID. I got to the account profile and settings screen, but when I moved the slider to activate the touchID, I got a pop-up saying I had to use a password because another account already had touchID enabled. Really? Another account with my ID number? Iâ€™m single!! 

Oh, and when I went back to the main screen after not being able to enable touchID, I got a pop-up saying â€œWeâ€™re here to helpâ€� and was logged out. Restarting my phone didnâ€™t solve the problems, either. This was all too much fun for one afternoon.",2018-07-06 14:52:54

And same way to quickly find my payment info or make payment,etc.   I would give 5 star but with the issue below I found, which to me is an important feature needed. 

I wanted to use touch ID to log in.  So I went to MENU/Profile/Login and Security to enable the Touch ID feature.  To test that, I logged out of the App first, right away I got prompted with either using Touch ID to log back in or clicking Cancel to cancel the Touch ID feature and use regular login  by manually entering password.  If I choose the Touch ID and I got no problem log back in which is good.  However if I’m done and want to completely log off, the only choice is to click Cancel, which seems to be designed to cancel the Touch ID feature.   The problem with that is if I want to login again,  I’ll have to use the regular log, i.e. manually enter my password.

For the time it was innovative. There has been virtually no functionality added or improved while there are new sites coming up fast and furious. HealthVault is primed to be a major player by being the connection point between many of the systems. Instead it relies on you to manually enter the data. It’s easier to save as pdf and stick it in the cloud. 

Some data does come over from insurance and pharmacies but it’s hit and miss so you never know what to trust. There is no way to sort so drugs are missed up randomly. Conditions are duplicated numerous times. 

It pulls over some lab procedures but no results and the fields are not properly set up to enter them. It would be simple to set up lab fields and just let users enter so they can tracks but instead it just a bunch of random fields that don’t allow for any comparison",2018-01-16 21:08:55

I just now tried to add data to my ""emotional state"" under trackers and the app crashed, and I tried to add data within ""heart rate"" under measurements and that too crashed the app. But even if Microsoft resolved these two of many problems there is still the practical issue of this product. I cannot share this data with anybody especially my doctor's office. Yesterday I had an appointment with my cardiologist and I frequently referenced this app for dates of procedures, medications, etc. and he wanted to know what I was referencing and I showed him. He said I had phenomenal records that he wished he could access, but he also noted there was no way to upload my digital X-rays, lab reports, and any other diagnostic reports from his office to my app which I wanted, so instead I have handfuls of CD ROMs that I have to open on my laptop instead of my app. This app just has very little to any practical usefulness other than recording medications, contact info, and lists of encounters and procedures.

Aetna Mobile,380845816,Some problems,KenB643,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id129623317,0.0,0.0,3,"I am able to logon with same user ID and password as web site.
However, I have discovered it sometimes issues a very misleading message that your
user name or password is incorrect when the real problem is apparently that the servers
are not responding.  It should always TELL THE TRUTH.  Lazy programming.
I discovered that the web site was having the same problem at some of those times.

I see others have complained that the claims function says they have no claims.
When you go to that function, there are two tabs on the page.
The left one is supposed to be a claims list.
Trial and error indicates it apparently defaults to listing claims that are no more than 30 days old
and I cannot find a way to change that.
So, it really just means you don't have any claims 30 days or less old.
THEY SHOULD SAY THAT!

If you use the ""Claim Search"" tab, you can select a longer period of time
or specific date range to search and it DOES find the qualifying/older claims.

I have mostly used it for viewing claims after receiving emails about them
so I don't have much experience with other features or lack thereof.",2012-07-05 16:04:59

While it's a great idea to have an ID card screen, that screen is useless if it's not legible. A blurry scan, no pinch-screen to enlarge ability, can't even view in landscape mode (hello,  developers: you did realize you were developing this for an iPhone, yes)?

You have to choose your specific plan from a long list of about 25 options -- which isn't alphabetized! So one has to read through a random list of every possible plan Aetna offers. 

The app needs an easy-to-view ID card screen -- not a scan but a clear info screen. It should also know/remember your plan when you're logged in. Fix these flaws and I will increase my star rating.",2011-12-11 07:49:06

It doesn't even at least have an option to remember user name. The ADP app at least saves your user name, and allows for a 4 digit pin. It's not like anyone can make any changes to your policy from the app or anything. It's just a decent app for finding nearby in-network urgent care facilities. It would be much better if it utilized the iPhone's Touch ID, like other apps, after an initial sign in after startup, etc.

It's very good for communicating with my doctors (given the HIPAA limitations on using regular email for that purpose) but it has a lot of problems in other areas (e.g., I can't use the appointment app to set an appointment with my oncologist who's been treating me for 5 years, only with my primary).  I have a sense that the app was released without any end user usability testing. 

My previous comments are still not addressed or even acknowledged: Newest release still shows ""no new"" messages/test results on opening menu screen when there are new of either type. Overall the app is a 3-4 but misleading and could cause patient to miss important information.  (Even if the programmers seem not to care, I would think the KP lawyers or the Office for Civil Rights might.)

Very nice that you can email your doctor too and you can even see your prescriptions and test results. Now the downside to this app is that it's kind of glitchy and was not tested adequately before launch. I can't scroll down my emails, the status bar that shows the time and battery life does not disappear, when setting an appt, it will show the location I need to go to but disappears after and I can't search for it any longer, not even in the appt status which will only show the general location.

1. Probably the first reason most people want the app is to make a doctors appt. But there's nowhere on the Dashboard to do that! For two years I thought the app didn't allow you to make an appt. I just discovered that there IS a way, it's just not listed on the Homepage Dashboard! You have to go searching thru about 3-4 steps to even find where to begin. Then, it doesn't really work...
2. When you finally get into ""make an appt,"" you can choose either ""make an appt within two days"" (with whatever dr. is available, I assume). It even tells you the two dates you have to choose from: today or tomorrow. But when you try to do that, there is no way to make it with anyone other than your PC dr; then it says, ""no appts available on those dates."" Right! That's why I am willing to see any dr- so I can get in, in less than three weeks (the wait for my PC). 
So bottom line-- there IS no way to make a short-term appt within the next two days. Which leaves you with two choices: (a) wait three weeks to see your PC, or (b) go to ER.

There's gotta be a better system, Kaiser! Seriously, sit down with an average client and have them try to negotiate this app!

Put that on your logon page if you think someone is not smart enough to know when to call 911 and get on with the message.

Also, too many steps to use options.  Users should not have to go thru so many steps for simple things like messages, prescription renewal or looking at lab results (pc version too).  And for prescriptions, WE LOG ON our account so why the extra verification steps.  A prescription renewal should be a checkbox list to click on the ones we need, not have to fill in a bunch of Rx numbers and click continue multiple times.",2012-08-09 10:18:30

No, you have to scroll way down, past your own text, past the precious emails from your doctor, and at the very bottom you can click ""send"", after which you are sent to a page that doesn't clearly tell you if the email was sent, or if you can view your sent email.  Do do that, you have to go back about 7 pages, then find a separate folder called ""emails to my doctor"", and then make sure you scroll down and wait for the spinning wheel to let you proceed.

Update: they have resolved the password issue as of the latest version of the app.  There are still a couple annoyances in the app now that I am logged in:

1. The addresses for facilities on my iPhone 5 don't fit in the box within the app meant to contain them and are sometimes unreadable. 

2. The regex for validating email addresses when submitting prescriptions isn't the same as the main site.  I like to use gmail's '+' operator within my email address for filtering. The main site account settings allow for this character but the prescription part states the email is invalid. As I have to change this every time I refill a prescription this gets annoying.

3. The error message for issue 2 is incorrect. The message is an invalid telephone number when the issue is an invalid email address.",2013-08-10 19:24:05

But, the password system drives me insane. I know that KP is overly concerned about privacy issues. Iâ€™m glad of that. But there has got to be a better way. I have a very complicated password for KP. I do not memorize it, because itâ€™s not memorizable (itâ€™s random letters, numbers and characters). I do this because I care about my privacy.

But Iâ€™ve got to copy the password out of 1Password then paste it into the password field of the login. And I canâ€™t do that. So, this app becomes almost useless to me.

1. Make an iPad / iPhone universal version. It's not that hard and would help those of us with multiple devices and those who have iPads and no other computer. 
2. In the Contact Us or the About the App sections, provide a place for feedback and bug reports.

However, great to be able to see your appointments, including your proxy (ie my childs) schedule too. Plus it automatically has all your kaiser doctors/nurses prelisted in email section

I can keep track of all my medical care, cost (if any), doctor's names and telephone numbers, and benefits. At a touch of my phone or iPad I have access to my questions, incentives rewards, and much more.  If for some reason my question has no answers here, I have telephone numbers that hook me up with the right specialist who can help answer my questions. Do you seek advice from their RNs on call?  It's there in the app. Phone numbers to assist you. Are you on vacation and need to go to Urgent Care or a doctor?  The app assist you with that too. Can't remember you doctor's phone number, or the spelling of their name?  Good news, it's all stored in the app to make life and those times of illness or accidents a bit easier so you can focus on getting better.

There is even a simple consent page with gives you and your spouse reciprocal access to the other's information.  For me that alone is invaluable.

myCigna,569266174,Too many mistakes to depend on as a usable app,Marietta Dave,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id230356373,2.0,2.0,2,"The only part of this app that I found to be usable, is a listing and address book of pharmacies in my area.

Using the ""price a drug"" area has been very misleading, and is often dead wrong. This specific area will commonly tell you that you can fill a 90 day order at a local pharmacy; this is almost never correct.

The drug mail order status area has too little detail.  For instance, a drug may be ""in process"" for many days. A phone call is required to find out what the problem is, completely negating the ease of use of this app. 

Also, the mail order status area will often list tracking numbers. I have found that some tracking numbers have no status for more than a week. I can only assume that a specific prescription was set to ship out on a certain date, but for some unknown reason is not sent.

I have also sent in prescriptions to be filled, only to find out a few weeks later that I had to call in and ""release the order"" for no reason whatsoever that could be explained to me.

These are just a few of the few dozen problems I have run into trying to use this app. I am very glad their customer service number is 7/24.",2017-04-27 16:55:36

The ONLY inconvenience I've run across so far is this... When there are multiple charges on one claim, the app shows the discount for each charge, but does not add them up in the end.

The Pros:
-The app keeps me up to date on  my Copay and deductible limits for me and the family. 
-Cigna covers my LTD claim as well, and with this app I have access to all of my coverage through Cigna. 
-everything I want to know is easily accessible, I can find doctors who are in network, and more importantly those that aren't. I can also see when a check has been cut for my LTD, no need to go to multiple sites.
-It helps me to keep Cigna on their toes in regards to mistakes made by them or my providers rather than being notified months later with a bill. 
Cons:
-Updates take longer to post.
-It has a tendency to freeze up or not allow you to sign in which generally happens after changes have been made and you have to contact mobile support to fix the glitch.

Surprising amount of physician and medical procedure information is available to the user once one learns where to find it in the application. 

Because the app requires users to log in with their unique name and password, one would expect to be able to see ""coverage specific information"" to their plan, unfortunately that is not the case; only the more general coverage summaries are available.

Unreliable:
The app is clearly maintained by developers with little experience in large database/mobile app integration. 

When the application does connect it can be very slow, very sloooow. Sometimes inbox will have a message that a section of the app may not be accessible at that time - probably due to upgrades and API development - to be expected given the infrastructure size and various databases being integrated - it's going to be a long haul to get this all working.

Frequently the app can NOT connect at all.",2015-06-14 08:48:20

Love that there are so very many sorting options (now that our spending options have popped up again), since sorting by open claims is far easier than skimming through still-processing older claims. It's also a blessing to be able to jump to EOBs on the run - especially at a hospital or doc's office.

I was trying to understand how my HRA account balance was calculated. There's little to no explanation. Actually no explanation why withdraws were made. I decided to call the support number since there were a number of withdraws I just didn't understand. 

The support line is probably the most exasperating part. It used to be super responsive, but I had to wait for 30 minutes before I could speak to a live person.

Would help that you expose all information, including the drug name on all communications .
Your password protection should include a reset feature, that is in the original communication, that allows the customer, to request a reset be sent to his email address so he can create a current pass word.
My sense is you are not understanding your customer base and should interview 8 or 10. 65+ year old customers.  
Think retail and what this 65+ year old customer receives at his local CVS or Walgreens .    Get competitive from a customer service perspective .

A) need ability to use 4 digit pin to sign on, PITA to keep entering uid and complex password over and over,
B) need ability to copy and paste passwords in the fields, sometimes they are incredibly complex,
C) need ability to project procedure costs based on my plan - similar to your website.

It would be nice tooooooi get a notification when it's was opened and read. And when the doctor replies, their email is compressed into an even smaller font so I am assuming that mine is too on their side. That's not a good thing.

After installing, I added the sign on info for two of the portals.  Medfusion immediately grabbed everything from them.  There was more information loaded into Medfusion than I had ever seen in either portal.    My third doctor was not on their list,  so I dropped the developers a note with the doctor's name and address.  Within 24 hours, I got an email telling me that they had been added!  Once I added my sign on info I had all of health info in one place.  On the downside, the formatting of the data pulled from the doctors is still a bit rough, and many of the items have no data inside them.  I'm sure that will improve over time.  I was able to use this to accumulate 2 years of blood sugar test results (7 tests) to show to my doctor.  He only had one in his chart.

UPDATE: I contacted support and was told 1) that despite sending a screenshot of the import file and the sleep records inside their tool with incorrect values after import, they could NOT see the problem. Basically, sleep records import has a bug in it that they will not acknowledge so you'll have to manually edit the bedtime and awake time for each entry after import; 2) it will take 7 to 10 days to see the synced records in the Fitbit app despite running hourly updates. This is unacceptable for me; 3) My concern about the 4+ hour delay to see the Google Fit data was not addressed; 4) As I stated above, I was told it will be 7 to 10 days before the updates synced TO fitbit yesterday will be visible in the Fitbit app. I'm back to wearing two devices on my wrist because this app doesn't work as expected PREVIOUS REVIEW: Sort of works 2) 1) After importing Sleep records, I had to manual correct the hours for Bedtime & Awake times; minutes and date were correct but all times showed the hour as midnight. 2) Hourly/automatic sync does not update any records for Google Fit or Fitbit.

The whole point or marketing strategy of the app is the service they provide with saving time and costs. This is not what you will experience. You will spend more money on a consultation that is not valuable and then you'll still have to go to your PCP or another provider. In addition you'll spend more time which is ultimately the worse.

In other words, the information seemed to by triplicated. However upon inspection the records did not match each other.

I have not had the data loss problems others mention, but I'm careful to back up my device, and have restored the records on device change. So what's wrong with it? 1. The bmi is not linked to your vital statistics record of your weight, you must separately update your ""official"" weight under general, as well as your height, rather than using the latest entry there. 2. There is no ability to filter results by date or similar criteria, important when you have been recording test results for a long period of time to demonstrate ""this is what happens when you put me on this medication."" 3. Send to other device only seems to support sending the entire dataset, not just a single individual in the record set. 4. The handling of medications could be improved. One may be taken off a medication, then put back on it. We should be able to record multiple start/stop dates. Currently, the workaround is to duplicate the medication entry.",2018-06-14 20:11:29
