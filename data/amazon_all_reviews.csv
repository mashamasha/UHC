23andMe,,23andme vs AncestryDNA plus Promethease - [updated Oct 2018],R. Holzle,,,6067,5.0,"Oct 2018 Update adds Alzheimer's section at end.

I had DNA analysis from 23andme. My wife had DNA analysis from both Ancestry(Anc) and 23andme. This review is my comparison of the two. I highly recommend secondary analysis of your results by Promethease, see further discussion at end of this review. Basically I like 23andme. If 23andme offers a lower cost ancestry only test, this is OK. For developing an ancestry tree, Ancestry.com is MUCH better IF you signup separately for Ancestry's subscription search service. Do not use Anc & Promethease for Alzheimer's - see discussion at end of this review.

TAKING TEST and SIGNUP – Very similar test taking. 23’s signup was more secure. Anc’s was easier, but they automatically put my wife’s test on my previously existing Ancestry account.

Waiting on RESULTS – Both send emails confirming sample receipt and when results were available. After logon, 23 provided step by step progress reports on the analysis process. The analysis process itself took about 10 days, including a holiday weekend. Total wait time was 3-4 weeks. Anc took 5 or so days longer than 23.

WEB SITE SECURITY – 23 is better. 23 requires a typical logon and password to get to the site. Anc automatically remembers your logon and password and just opens up when you go to the site. However, actually downloading your DNA file from Anc requires a full sign-on and confirmation link via your e-mail..

Ethnic Origin Analysis – I think 23 is (more correct). However Anc in Sept 2018 updated their report with better results. My sister did an ANC test in 2016 and I did one in 2018, the ethnic origin results were a fair bit different - not sure why.

DNA RELATIVE IDENTIFICATION – Recognizing that allocation of relatives to 1st, 2nd and 3rd cousins is somewhat imprecise. For my wife, 23 identified 4 second cousins and about 32 third cousins. Anc identified 1 first cousin, 2 second cousins and 9 third cousins. 23 also has ‘cousins’ outside the USA (in my case in the UK) which are really valuable contacts for ancestry searching. The web site does not directly identify a cousin’s location but you can easily guess this from supplementary info optionally provided by the cousin on 23’s site.

DNA RELATIVE CONTACT and ANALYSIS – Anc provides the e-mail for a contact and shared ancestors for each DNA relative. You get a lot more when you pay for their regular Ancestry services, see below. 23 provides an internal messaging application for communicating with contacts. The application works but is rudimentary and unsuitable for more than brief messages (especially with MS Edge); exchanging e-mail address’s after contact is more satisfying. Both have a couple levels of ‘sharing’ (aka privacy). Both have tools for grouping contacts.

Anc provides a powerful tree searching tool IF you subscribe to the regular Ancestry service. This is expensive, in the range of $200/year, but less with special offers. Given the moderate ‘tools’ in their basic DNA service, I view their DNA analysis as an (effective) teaser for their subscription service. UPDATE: I did signup for the Ancestry services and they are great. Specifically, with a subscription their DNA site shows a contacts pedigree chart if that contact already has built an Anc family tree. This is MASSIVELY better than 23's unsorted list of surnames. When you search for a particular name it searches all of the connected family trees - this is exceptionally useful.

MEDICAL INFO – Anc provides no medical info. In late 2016 23 had two test options - $100 for just the ancestry service and $200 for ancestry plus medical. As of Sept 2018, 23 provides FDA approved reports on your risk of 9 medical conditions, including Alzheimer's, plus several genetic carrier reports. Their discussion/explanation of your risks for these conditions is specifically approved by the FDA and is reasonably understandable, informative, and useful.

If you are so inclined, you can participate (answer a lot of online questions) in 23’s medical research. This is probably 20 ten minute questions sessions. I did this and feel like it was useful for medical research.

Analysis of you DNA results by Promethease, a third party service, provides excellent medical info.

CONNECTION to PROMETHEASE – Promethease (Prom) is a third party service that assess’s your detailed DNA results from either 23 or Anc and provides a detailed medical risk report. Go to the Prom site to get started. The download process is not too difficult. In Oct 2018 cost is $12 per report.

PROMETHEASE RESULTS –Prom generates 20,000 or so reports (hits) from the 700,000 or so genes that are tested by 23 and Anc. 23 and Anc test a different set of genes, although they mostly overlap. For my wife’s test from both 23 and Anc the corresponding Prom reports were about 85% the same for the 40 most significant hits (Prom magnitude 2.5 and above). There were 5 or 6 unique hits in the top 40 for each report. I judge that the unique hits were about equally important, between 23 and Anc - none were critical.

[Nov 2017 Update] In October 2017 I resubmitted by 2016 23 test to Prom. About 15% of the hits were changed. A couple unusual hits were deleted. A very significant change was that one gene comment changed from 'increased risk of Type 1 diabetes' to '18x risk of Type 1 diabetes'!!! I read up on this. It turns out that the genetic > diabetes risk/connection is currently a very hot and complex research topic. The relevant research report was published in 2017. My suggestion is to update your Prom report every year or two if there are concerns.

USING PROMETHEASE – IMPORTANT – Use of general DNA analysis to identify general medical conditions is an emerging (not well developed) technology/business. My guess is that the info provided by Prom is perhaps 30% or so of what will be available in 10 years or so. I regard the info provide as indicative, definitely not complete and possibly incorrect (due to either testing error or interpretation error).

Having said that, it is interesting, likely useful and potentially lifesaving. The information will be disturbing (negative), but in most cases not surprising. I think most people will be able to absorb the info without getting too stressed out. If you are a hypochondriac, this could be a problem. If you want a chance of good news, you can write down the stuff your are concerned about ahead of time, and then see if they actually shows up.

My comments for using the report are:
• Make sure you download a copy to your PC for future reference, don’t just look at it online.
• After you figure out how to use the report, move the '0' Magnitude slider up to a range of 2.5 or so. This will limit you to the top 40 or so hits. Then go down to the bottom of the report and hit the '2X' bar a few times to see all the hits.
• You can then hit the ‘Table’ button at the top and print a summary of the hits to help see the big picture. You can also open this table in Excel and modify/save it for a more useful table. If you do this, add a Frequency column if it's not already there.
• To me, after Magnitude, the most important factor is ‘Frequency’. This is what percentage of the target population has this condition. If its around 40% or higher, I think it’s already ‘dialed in’ to the normal medical process – it is something your doctor and the medical community will look for in any case. Most of the hits fall into this category. If it’s less than 10%, it’s likely not on your doctors radar screen and you will want to consider if it’s worth mentioning to your doctor.
• The second most useful item is the relative increased risk in the item discussion. Recognize that the absolute risk is not provided – this could be 1 in 100,000, so a 1.1 relative risk is almost meaningless. On the other hand I looked up AMD (Age Related Macular Degeneration-eye problems) on the internet; it affects 1 in 3 to 5 people by age 80, so 2x risk is really significant. Good to know this ahead of time.
• After you assess the top 40, which takes a while, you can expand the Magnitude to it’s full range. Then click on ‘Topics’ and click on sub topics of interest and see if any common concerns emerge. Do the same for ‘Medical Conditions’. This seems like a lot of work but only takes an hour or 2 once you get started. For me the common themes seem to be heart disease, Alzheimer’s and Rheumatoid arthritis – none of which are a surprise.
- When you find something that might be relevant you NEED to do supplemental research on the Internet. The Prom report is a brief and simple identification. Fuller understanding can significantly change (reduce?) your concern for the issue. Be aware that there are 'hypochondriac' web site for some of these issues. I like to start with Wiki, Mayo Clinic and WebMD. Search for the Prom gene name 'rs........'. Then find out what the common term(s) for the gene is e.g. MTFHR and search for that. Write stuff down, gene names can be confusing.
• Again, remember this is an emerging technology, so the results will change from year to year for a while. I guess that in 10 years it will be a routine consideration in a physical.

IMPORTANT. DO NOT Prom results from Anc for Alzheimer's. Anc almost always reports zero copies of the Alz APOE4 gene. Prom notes this in their report, but it’s carries a low Magnitude and is easy to miss. In Sept 2018 I did an Anc test and it returned (via Prom), Zero copies of the Alz gene. The Anc > Prom medical results were otherwise similar but slightly less extensive than 23 > Prom.",2017-01-22 00:00:00
23andMe,,Disgusted,Ama_customer,,,573,1.0,"I had to submit DNA twice and both times they said it failed on their end. Then they stated I am NEVER allowed to try again in the future. I purchased kits for the entire family and linked everyone to my account. What a huge waste of time. Funny thing is, I did ancestry.com at the same time and that gave me results in under 3 weeks!",2018-05-23 00:00:00
23andMe,,NOT happy,paxaw,,,717,1.0,"We bought two kits. My husband got his back in a couple of weeks and I waited and waited and waited...no communication. After 6 wks I emailed and they gave me some canned response “maybe there was difficulty” and let it go. I emailed them after for more details and got no response. A week later I noticed that their original email came with a survey so I filled it out stating that I was unsatisfied. Got a response stating that they tried to extract my DNA several times but couldnt and sometimes that happens. Bam, end of email...no next steps, no heres another extraction kit, nothing. It was like the CSR would only answer one topic per email. WHY did I have to wait 6+ weeks only to find out that there was an issue? If this is a thing that sometimes happens then shouldnt there be a policy in place to notify customers?! They had the results at their fngertips when I emailed so obviously my results were in, they were just sitting on someones desk waiting for ME to call THEM?! I could understand poor customer service if I were buying candybars, not $200 kits. Totally unacceptable. Still not resolved. Also, my husband’s results were totally lame. They provided stupid facts like “you’re less likely to flush after drinking alcohol, you’re more like to consume caffeine...”. Um...those are things that he already knows. My expectation was that the medical version of this kit was going to give medical information, e.g.: you’re predisposed for x disease, etc. A waste all around.",2018-01-24 00:00:00
23andMe,,SOLVED AN 83+ YEAR OLD MYSTERY OF MY GRANDFATHER'S IDENTITY,Coastal Girl,,,2159,5.0,"The testing is fairly simple: You receive a test vial (log in and register it on their website) and provide saliva up to the control line. Make sure you don't eat or drink for 30 to 45 minutes before providing your saliva sample. It is best not to brush teeth beforehand since it will only wash away valuable DNA and you want to ensure your sample has enough to process. Yes I had a few failed kits in my life and that set us back months of getting results on those kits. Anyway it’s fairly simple to provide saliva samples. Simple enough I had my 5 1/2 year old done and she was the easiest one to process. Then you place the kit back into included return envelope and wait for about 6 to 8 weeks for it to process. All while keeping tabs of the process online as each step finishes.

I started using 23andme in 2012 before the FDA had gotten nasty and demanded they stop providing such detailed health analysis. Most of the kits I purchased (all but 2) included the ancestry with health but the ancestry portion was the sole purpose for us using 23andme services. I have tested both of my parents, my two children, two paternal aunts, my daughter's paternal grandmother as well as myself and two cousins whom I tested to confirm our relationship. If you test at least one parent, you can easily sort matches that are shared with that parent to determine which matches are maternal and paternal. Since both my parents have tested mine literally shows who matches me from each side and my children can sort their matches based on me being tested too.

My paternal grandfather died in 1995 and took with him the secret of his past. He had ran away as a young boy and changed his name so we knew him only by the name he had taken. My family always yearned to know more about my grandfather's past but he had endured some sort of trauma or something and for whatever reason chose to never speak of it again. So we grew up only knowing half my father's ancestry - that of his mother.

After my grandfather died, I set out on a mission to try to figure out more about his past and his identity. I sent off for birth and school records and hit one dead-end after another trying to prove he was who he said he was. I spent hours going over census data on Ancestry's website, writing to courthouses across the country. The evidence pointed to the conclusion he was not who he said he was and so I had nothing solid to go by. Until 17 years into chasing cold trails, I discovered ancestry type DNA testing. I figured it wouldn't hurt to order my dad a kit and see where that would take us. If I could just find one close enough match then maybe it would give us a good lead on figuring out my grandfather's real surname.

After waiting for what seemed like months (it was actually only about 6 weeks) my dad's DNA was online (on 23andme’s secure site) and accessible along with all his many matches - which were basically cousins at various degrees of distance. It was one cousin (a predicted second cousin) in particular that gave me access to their family tree and actually dove in with me searching for clues that would lead us to my grandfather.

Just 6 months into researching my father's DNA, I found my grandfather's family and figured out who he really was. I wanted to ensure that my information was correct and so I contacted the daughters to the man I believed to be my grandfather's brother and offered to test them both. Their test results confirmed they were indeed our 1st cousins. I have since been in contact with close and distant family via this newly discovered paternal side and even obtained a copy of my grandfather's family surname book. His absence was even recorded in the book! I solved an 83+ year mystery and gained a family I longed my entire life to know about. I cannot be more thankful that these tests are available and that it gives us such ability to solve things that seem impossible.

Granted this all sounds way easier than it was and in all honesty it took planning and sorting and meticulous record-keeping to rule out my father's maternal matches. I literally mapped my father's DNA and researched every match labeling in an Excel document, which chromosome location that relative fit and what surnames fit within those matches. It’s given me new found respect and interest in knowing about each and every ancestor that left their mark within our DNA. It’s time-consuming, rewarding and addicting. I can say that with all honesty as I now manage 15+ kits on various DNA web sites. I tested myself and both parents on 23andme as well as AncestryDNA and Dad was also tested on FTDNA but I met my most useful matches on 23andme. It was on 23andme that I found the best ability to pour over chromosomes researching every detail I could.

Oddly between 23andme and Ancestry their tests show a discrepancy in ethnicity estimates. One shows that my dad has a tiny trace of Native American (23andme) yet AncestryDNA does not show any trace whatsoever of Native American. My son has confirmed Native American and was only tested on 23andme and his percentage came back at nearly exact what is on his BIA blood quantum card. So I lean in feeling more comfortable with 23andme’s ethnicity estimates.

IMPORTANT TO NOTE: You can take your raw data (once your DNA is processed) and download it from any of these DNA testing sites and upload them for free to GEDmatch. That site allows you to cross compare other matches on there from all the DNA sites. As long as others have their data on their too you can look at those matches and even see where the match is on individual chromosomes, etc. It’s a great tool to utilize along with your DNA testing sites.

FINAL THOUGHT: If you are looking to solve a mystery, 23andme is great. If you are looking to just fill in a family tree and you have a paid Ancestry membership or you are willing to pay for it, I would also suggest AncestryDNA. AncestryDNA gives you immediate access to your matches’ trees and you can in turn build on your own tree with the information. But if you are NOT a paid member to Ancestry, their AncestryDNA features are limited. I personally think its poor business practice for Ancestry to force people who already fork over money for the DNA kits to further pay to utilize services that should be totally included within the purchase of the kit. With 23andme, there are no additional hidden usage fees.

Whichever one you choose, be prepared to discover a new you.",2016-11-30 00:00:00

You will be clumped under a ‘genetically similar’ group which could span a subcontinent. Forget finding out what percentage came from what area.

I repeated the test again following all instructions as I did in the first test and sent it back to them. Another month later I get the same email stating they can't process the test and they would issue a refund. I have called several times and emailed customer service, but they keep giving me the run around about my refund.

Then go to Promethease.com and dna.land.com and import your results (when their available from 23andMe), For $5.00 they give you loads of medical and other misc. insights from your genetic information. Importing is quick and easy, do it right from the Promethease website (links to 23andMe directly and grabs your data. dna.land requires you to upload data yourself). Just be sure to download a copy of the final results to your computer for future reference (as Promethease will automatically delete information from their servers after 4 months). DNA.LAND is free (it's a research project) well worth the extra effort and produces some more interesting results.",2017-01-22 00:00:00

We finally got someone who looks like they will help, but we will see, a lot of time has been spent on this.

The traits were a bit off. I love cilantro for example and it suggested I wouldn't. Little things.

We dropped the kit in the mail on Christmas day, but even from Phoenix, AZ it still took apparently a week and a half to reach the lab. That was the last completed update. Today is February 17th and I feel like I was sold a $100 box. This has been a complete rip off, and I highly advise anyone considering 23 and Me as a gift or for themselves, to go with another company.

I email customer service to help seek out the possible issue. Which I was told that I needed to register the kit, and was sent a link to the registration page. Clearly, this does not solve the problem. I was eventually able to get it registered, or so I thought. Before mailing the kit back, I wrote down the barcode just in case there were more problems. Few weeks pass, and I'm curious as to what the status is of the sample. I log on to the 23andme website, I'm greeted with a page that says I've not set up a profile and wants to know if I want to buy a kit. I tried registering the kit again just to be told that the barcode is already registered. Once again emailed customer support, explaining the problem, I was given a few possible explanations about how it might have happened, but once again I was told to go to the registration page and register my kit. Not sure how one is supposed to do that, given I clearly stated in the email that it said it was already registered.

23andme is not just ancestry, you get so much more. Here's a few things I got out of it...
1) I learned about my ancestry and how I am 24% Lithuanian, which was spot on as my grandma was born there.
2) I have at least 1000 cousins (3rd, 4th and 5th cousins.)
3) I can see a map of where my relatives are located and can be contacted/contact them if they also opted in for communication.
4) I learned I do not carry the breast cancer genes (thank god!)
5) I learned I do carry a mutation that lowers cholesterol and helps guard against heart disease (looked that gene up after seeing it in the news.)
6) Anytime I see any study in the news about genetics and how they found this gene associated with this disease etc, I can log in to 23andme, pull up my data and see if I carry that mutation or not. So geeky, but soooo cool.
7) I learned I have the mthfr mutation and was able to read more about what this means so I can make better choices regarding which types of folate I consume.
8) I learned I have a double mutation that effects b12 processing which could explain why I have always been low in b12. I will now ensure I get more b12 and monitor my levels with my doctor for the rest of my life.
9) I gained a new outlook on people. I think it's so incredibly that we are all essentially ""written in code."" It's this code that defines our health, how we look and to an extent, even how we act.",2015-01-01 00:00:00

23andMe,,Industry Leader for Health related Home DNA kits,T Stanley,,,47,5.0,"I bought this with Prime and it took exactly 2 weeks from the moment I clicked ""buy"" until my reports were published. I may be one of the lucky ones but I think it is because I bought the kit April 20 2018 - so it wasn't during any holiday rush periods. From reviews, I would hesitate buying this around Christmas time if you aren't patient - they seem to get slammed and delays seem normal.
This and Ancestry.com seems to be the top 2 kits in most comparison reviews. Ancestry for heritage related results due to larger database & this for health related results. I chose this one because of the health related results and because Ancestry requires extra costs to integrate DNA results into their extensive database. Ancestry does not offer health related results to my knowledge but I think you can export the data into 3rd party tools to get those results.
One note of warning - there are kits on ebay that are a bit cheaper but most of those do not include the lab work - and I've not seen any that were cheaper than buying the kit with lab on Amazon. Read the fine print if you look on ebay.
2nd note of warning - I wouldn't do this at all if you are concerned about your DNA being hacked and shared. There are reports on Internet that FBI is searching these databases for criminals - and if you believe the government is able to secure secrets the way x-files portrays, then maybe it's safe forever. Personally, I can't think of any realistic consequence to my DNA being shared that outweighs the benefit of knowing my DNA. If I get tied up in a lab so they can harvest my stem cells because I'm the beginning of an x-men mutation, I guess I'll have plenty of time to think about my decision.
The kit itself is very simple. Once you receive the kit (2 days with prime) and before you collect specimen (saliva), you open an account with 23andMe and enter the code off the vial in the kit. You will make some decisions about the process at that point - such as if you want your data used for research and if they can keep your dna samples for future use, etc. Once that is done, you will need to clean your mouth very well and not eat/drink for an hour or so before spitting into the vial. I cleaned my mouth very well before going to bed, drank a big glass of water when I woke (so I could spit easily), and waited an hour and filled the vial. Spit until clear saliva is just above the indicated line - the bubbles will all be floating above that line. It doesn't take much and you don't want to overfill it by much or you may not have enough stabilizer for the amount of saliva. The vial initially has a funnel on the top that you close the lid and it will release the stabilizer into the vial. Once you have stabilizer in saliva, remove the funnel and replace it with the round cap. Shake it well and put the sealed vial into the included baggie. Box it back into the original box which is addressed and has prepaid postage - ship it off. I had mine back in the mail on the 3rd day after ordering.
I used the iphone app at this point. The app tracks progress of each step. It didn't show the post office received the package, but in 2 days or so the status jumped to the vial being received and being pre-checked. Each step seemed to complete about 2 - 3 days apart until the reports became available.
Be sure to switch to a computer at some point. It either has more options, or they are easier to find there - especially where contacting others is concerned.
I am no DNA expert, but the results are interesting to read over. It found my niece who took the test successfully and correctly identified her in my lineage. She had shared her ancestry results so people could find her. Contacting matches is easy with the messenger in the online tool.
I think the results I've seen are pretty accurate - some of the expected traits are off - it seems to do better with hair, eye color and skin tone than things like attached/detached earlobes and which finger is longer. Since some of those are wrong, I'm not sure there is much more value in that than going to an old gypsy woman looking into a glass ball but it's entertaining to see the predictions.
Recognize you can export the raw data into other tools - Prometheus seems to be most popular - to have reports run to interpret the data. 23andMe seems to keep things at a level that is more manageable. I only exported to Prometheus which is about $5 to $10 usually, but free for this week. If you really get into this stuff, I think it's worthwhile to see those results, but Prometheus gets a little confusing because you can have one result reducing your risk for something by some multiplier and another increasing your risk for it. Do they cancel out? 23andme tends to just tell you increased or decreased risk.
Where I think this is weak - is for determining Native American ancestry. If that is your goal, you may want to research DNA accuracy for that before spending your money. My research shows that getting matches on that must be fairly close to the ancestors - mine showed none in my lineage. My grandmother always said she was part Indian and she looked the part so I tend to believe her. It wasn't until I found no matches that I started researching why - and it sounds like it is common for that to be missed by most DNA ancestry kits.
My overall thoughts - I question the accuracy of some risks indicated - I just don't think we are really there yet. I personally think one can only say labs see this sort of trend when this strand is found. Prometheus shows relationships for genes and medicines that may not metabolize properly for me. I am capturing that to discuss with my doctor - just in case. The ancestry part does work reliably to find relatives and seems to be fairly accurate to place them where they branch off from your family tree.",2018-05-05 00:00:00

I called and tried to tell them they must have gotten the test mixed up with someone else's DNA because I knew without a doubt the results were wrong. They argued with me that, that wasn't possible.
They didn't seem to understand what I was trying to tell them. I mainly did it for the health and medical markers, just curious. Their findings were that I didn't have DNA markers for certain health issues yet I have every single medical condition they said I didn't have the marker for. And, some of those are hereditary (DNA hereditary). My mother, father, siblings, and other family members have these issues as well. I didn't need a DNA test to tell me that I didn't have the marker I already knew I had?

23andMe,,Great for the Nerd in Your Life,Ivonne Kessler,,,19,5.0,"The estimated time of completion (once received and the sample passed screening) was 6-8 weeks. I ordered this product November 24th, received it on the 26th, sent it out on the 27th, it made it to the facility late on the 30th and the reports were complete on the 8th of December! That's fourteen days from clicking the purchase button to receiving the results or one day over a week from passing inspection!
I purchased this as a Christmas gift for myself during a Black Friday deal ($100 versus the usual $200 or $150 during Black Friday on the website). I've always wanted to find out some of my genetic information and possibly use it to create a family tree. I felt like this was a really great deal and therefore the perfect time to try this out.
When it arrived it looked very much like the kit pictured (will upload pictures at a later point). The instructions were easy to follow. I was worried about the quality of the sample, so I brushed my teeth before going to bed and immediately (before breakfast or brushing my teeth again) collected a spit sample. They are quite serious about the fill line. Don't try to be an overachiever. The coagulant still has to go in the rest of the tube! Shake for about 5 seconds and marvel as your clear saliva produces a filmy substance (THAT'S YOUR DNA!!!!). It's pretty cool. Absolutely DO NOT forget to register your tube. I took a picture, registered it, and wrote it down in several places. After packing it up and putting it in the mailbox, I realized that I'd forgotten to take down the tracking number (the kit box has the prepaid shipping label on it). I was a bit distraught, but when I logged onto my 23andMe account, there was a chromosome timeline with each step (there's approximately 9 steps) clearly defined and the first step was having the package scanned at a mailing facility (so tube # is associated with the tracking number). I'll admit, I checked daily and filled out as many survey questions as I could. I really wasn't anticipating any surprises, the very skinny family tree that I'm aware of pretty much all goes back to Germany or Prussia in the 1700s. Well, my family and I were in for a shock when the results came back and said that I had an Irish/English ancestor and a bit further back, an Ashkenazi Jewish ancestor. The overall composition was 100% European, mostly in the Northwestern Region. No other surprising ancestors in the wood works. While I fully understand that this cannot be used as a medical diagnostic tool, it was neat to see the genetic health results (it should be noted that these are not conclusive by any means). The Carrier Status reports were interesting. I didn't have anything flagged, so I didn't spend much time looking at those results. The Genetic Health Risk reports did have a bit of a surprise. Apparently I am at an increased risk of developing Celiac Disease because of my genome (doesn't mean I'll get it, but it's something to look out for). The Trait reports were fun to go through, they all lined up. I haven't really dug into those reports yet, but so far they look fun from a scientist perspective (Biology major). I think the Wellness reports are perhaps the most immediately useful results for your individual health. I did find one report to be a bit faulty (but I'm weird). I'm likely to be lactose intolerant, which most of the world is despite the mutation to produce Lactase into adulthood occurring 3 times in human evolution (Anthropology as a second major). Milk and other dairy products make up a considerable amount of my diet and I am considered an adult. I'm really not sure how to explain that one hiccup.
23andMe found 1175 people that are related to me. This is out of the pool of people who have actually used 23andMe. My relatives on 23andMe are all 10th degree relations (google coefficient of relationship), so the most closely related person is about a fourth cousin with less than 0.4% shared DNA. So we shared a great-great-great-grandparent.
I would definitely recommend this product if you are curious about your ancestry or just want to secrets your DNA may hold, or if you know someone who just loves this type of stuff.
Before purchasing, I was definitely a bit leery of what I was getting myself into. Is it really worth up to $200 to spit in a tube? Yep. If you want to break it down shipping a small flat rate box is approximately $6.45, multiplied by two because you got it shipped to your house and then you mailed it out. If they mass produce the kits, the kit itself isn't going to be too expensive, maybe $5-10, it's very simple and elegantly put together. So rounding up, we're at a max of $25 just for the test and mailing. Then there's the process that your DNA has to go through (6-ish steps once it has passed the inspection) before your reports are generated. There's scientists working on your DNA and processing it through various techniques (there are tutorial videos that explain the process on the website), so there's expensive machinery that most people have limited access to being utilized (don't really know how to put a price tag on this). Then, there are the 79 reports. If you bought the kit for $100, each report is less than $1, if you bought the kit for full price at $200, each report is close to $2 each. There's a wealth of information that you really can't put a price tag on.
I also purchased the AncestryDNA kit through Ancestry.com. I have not yet submitted it, but when it's complete, I will add a comparison. The kit itself was $65 (on sale), but lots of people recommended having an Ancestry.com account in order to unlock the full potential - so not really that much cheaper than 23andMe.",2017-12-12 00:00:00

23andMe,,Comprehensive Results Presented Well,Brian Lev,,,8,5.0,"I purchased this kit after researching several different DNA test kits available to the general public because our primary goal was to learn if there was anything to worry about in the genome of a family member who was adopted & whose biological family's medical history is unknown. (Not all DNA kits test for the same thing, so please do your own research online as to which would best serve your needs.) Not only was this test one of the most comprehensive from a medical standpoint, it was also one of only three that our state legislature has specifically said is allowed under local consumer protection laws.

The results came back quickly and were presented in an easy-to-understand format, with comprehensive coverage of a wide range of genetic markers, recessives, carrier genes, etc. Although there are some privacy concerns regarding ""outside"" use of this data (concerns that apply in varying degrees to ALL commercial genetic tests, not just 23andMe's), the value of the knowledge gained far outweighed any such concerns for my family. (This subject is a very personal opinion; I mention it only because it has come up in every conversation I have had after mentioning I had purchased this test kit.)

I do not currently plan to do any further testing, but would certainly purchase the 23andMe kit again to do so. The service was relatively fast and (with the purchase of a higher-end version of the kit) the tests was very comprehensive.",2018-05-07 00:00:00

Finally emailed support - oh we just got it!

Well great, fine, whatever.

Here we are a month later and just got a message - can't extract DNA. Oh great.

So here we are, I've spent money for the most expensive kit and so far I've had a broken tracking number, crap service, and two months of my life wasted waiting because their process is trash. Gosh I'm glad I spent hundreds on this.

I got the results back a bit early, but was dissapointed with the results. Allow me to explain, I bought this because I thought it could give me detailed informtaion on my ethnicity. It just said, ""Middle Eastern"". I was aware I was Middle Eastern, but I wanted more specific countires rather than a genral area. My friend is Japanese and it said specifically Japanese, not just ""East Asian"". Can you see why I'm dissapointed?",2018-02-04 00:00:00

The reason for the 3 star review is that they did not email or call to let me know this, they just let me wait for weeks and weeks. I had to call myself to find out what was going on. Fortunately, though, they did give me a refund.",2018-06-05 00:00:00
23andMe,,"Not Perfect, but Revealing",Lord McFatty,,,2,5.0,"There are a few things you should keep in mind if you plan on using one of these kits:

First, you have to keep in mind that personal genome sequencing has only been a thing since 2007, therefore it's still not a comprehensive or complete science. As more people participate in personal genome sequencing the results are going to get better, so that means that you have to expect occasional improvements in ancestry composition. For example, my initial ancestry report listed me as 24% French and 21% Scandinavian. After a recent update, my French composition lowered down to 19.6%, my Scandinavian stayed the same, but my British & Irish composition went up. The short of it is that as the collection and science improve, so to will your results so don't be sold on receiving definitive results. If you want a closer to perfect test, just wait another 10 years.

Second, you may be surprised by your ancestry. I grew up around the Greek side of my family, so I always closely identified with Greek culture. The test says I'm only 2.3% Greek and originally I thought, ""something must be wrong...I mean... my Great Grandfather was from Greece!"". That's not how DNA works. You are not a perfect 50/50 split of your parent's DNA, so you may have inherited more of one side compared to another. In my case, I really inherited a lot more from my Dad. If you really want a more comprehensive idea of what you inherited from which parent, then they will also need to buy a kit and add you as a child. Don't let the results stand in the way of who you were raised to be, but also take pride in the things you find out you are.

Third, the health reports are really interesting. In the traits breakdown it got everything right, including the color of my eyes, hair, length of my toes, etc. It was really crazy to see how much your DNA can predict! I also can sleep well at night knowing health risks and carrier status. Luckily I apparently have healthy DNA!

Finally, my one criticism is that the family connection portion of 23andme is not as active of a community as on Ancestry. If a primary driver to take a test is to find family and connect with them, then Ancestry might be a better option for you.",2018-12-18 00:00:00

23andMe,,Expensive and Subpar,KindleBabe,,,1,1.0,"There are better DNA kits out there for far less money. The health tests for this kit are not very useful and are definitely not worth the extra $100 per kit. Most of the things the health test will tell you about are traits you should have already figured out yourself (like whether black hair or red hair runs in your family or whether you have cheek dimples) or are pretty silly (like whether you can smell asparagus or taste bitter tastes). It's not great for finding DNA relatives because there is a glitch that deletes message between users, so if you try to contact a DNA relative, they may not get your message or you may not get their reply. Sometimes messages show at first but then disappear later. They've done nothing to fix this problem. It also seems like this kit has a higher-than-average fail rate for extracting DNA. I don't know if that's because of the lab, the saliva test itself, or the instructions, which may be difficult for some people (especially elderly people) to understand. If you have a problem with the instructions or the kit itself, don't expect help, a new kit, or a refund. I regret this purchase and cannot recommend it to anyone else.",2018-12-28 00:00:00

23andMe,,Warning: May Find Familial Skeletons,Jucribru,,,2,4.0,"I got this on a Black Friday deal so I could get the health report half off. Luckily my suspicions were correct that my family is generally robust health-wise. It also confirmed what I already knew about my ancestry, though it didn't help me narrow down my Northwest European ancestry to a specific place like I'd hoped. No haggis and bagpipes for me I guess.

To be honest I was a little ""meh"" about it since it didn't really give me much new info, until a few weeks later someone who had been adopted at birth and was looking for her bio parents contacted me. Turns out I have a whole new 1st cousin none of us knew about, and a naughty uncle who never told us about it.

Our results closely matched what we knew of our families, but offered a few things we didn't know as well. The end product was both enjoyable and informative.

Wednesday they began DNA analysis and Friday they finished their quality review and began generating my reports. On Sunday I got my results. Expected time to ship your DNA to the lab is 2-4 weeks. Mine got there in 2 days. I expected to wait 6-8 weeks before getting my results, but got them 8 days after shipping the package. It was very exciting getting my ancestry and health results back, as I'm adopted and wasn't sure of my nationality or any health risks.

My results came back in about seven weeks, and was surprisingly very accurate. It seems that the more diverse your ancestral profile is, the less satisfaction you'll have with it. Mine was straight 50/50, so there was no ambiguity about it. The results are further broken down into specific global regions of your ancestry origins. I found it to be extremely helpful. The traits, diseases and other information was also straightforward and easy to read. It's a quality kit with fantastic information. I've had suspicions about my ancestral origins, and the results proved them correct. What I really liked was the results pinpointed on a time line, specific years of ancestry, so you can plot migration patterns. Mine went back to the 1700's Native Americans, then migrated out to Eastern Asia around 1800. It mentioned my 3rd or 4th grandfather was most likely from a specific region of a specific country, and the approximate years he was alive. Very cool! BUY IT.

I wanted to do this test for years and finally decided it was worth the expense. Once I received the kit, I followed all of the instructions - I registered my kit, the morning before brushing my teeth I filled the tube with my saliva, closed it up according to directions and shipped it. I wasn't expecting results until mid-Feb, which gave them 8 weeks to process. They received my kit on Dec 2, I had my results by Jan 2. What a way to ring in the new year!

I spent time answering a bunch of the questionnaires they offer - all in the name of science! The more I share, I figure the more I help them discover gene expression. Some Amazon reviewers were upset that they were asked to answer these questions, but it isn't mandatory that you answer all of them.

I feel like I know SO MUCH more about myself. The way it traces back your ancestry is amazing. I have Iberian lineage?? Who knew?? I had to google Iberia! I shared my results with other users - I have 1,116 third and fourth cousins who've also done a 23andMe kit. Mind blown. I learned a lot about my wellness. I have the muscle fiber found in elite power athletes?!?!? Cool! I wish I has the joints to train like one...

I read a ton of the reviews before ordering, both on this site and the web. I feel great about my decision to use 23andMe. They really break down the science behind the test so you get a complete understanding of what you are looking at, there are tutorials on some of the items.

It honestly took a little longer than I thought (or maybe I'm just impatient), though I sent my test back right at the end of November and it seems like the holiday season is super busy for the company. I wouldn't say that I had super mind-blowing results (it's pretty much in line with what I expected except for a curveball heritage percentage of >.01, which is basically negligible anyway), but I enjoyed reviewing my results.

I opted for the thorough test with health stuff to and some of that stuff was even cooler. All the hereditary disease stuff I tested negative for so I can't really speak to that, though I wouldn't say I feel relieved in any way b/c I wasn't familiar with most of the things they were testing for anyway. I found the behavioral results (e.g., the ones that gauge how likely you are to to fall asleep quickly or whether you toss and turn at night, etc.) to be super fascinating.

All in all, really cool to do, and I'd recommend people trying it out. I got my kit at a pretty steep discount on Black Friday and I'm not sure, given my results I'd want to pay full price. However, if you can find the test on sale, definitely go for it.

Sadly I have to pay twice for the test kits from both companies and also pay twice to have the raw data analyzed.

After reviewing the results, I found them to be incredibly accurate, both for ancestry and for identifying congenital health issues experienced by my family members through the last several generations. Additionally, I have already been contacted by, and identified, numerous distant family members I had never been aware of before now, whose genealogy squares up with mine.

My only two complaints about the test are 1) it takes a long time to get results (we've done the testing with 5 people in the family and on average it has taken 6 weeks to get results) and 2) the results are known to be inaccurate in some cases, as some of my family members now that they have certain diseases that the test says they are negative for. This second point is a huge one in that it makes the other data impossible to rely upon, since if one knows that the test is providing a false negative, then it could very well be reporting false negatives and positives in other areas.",2018-04-01 00:00:00

This man is my mom's first cousin, and I'm excited to give her this kit for her birthday so she can tell him about our family, since he is her first cousin & she knows his dad and other family members I'm not familiar with. It's better to buy from Amazon; you pay $10.00 for shipping on the 23andMe website. Here, I got it in 2 days with prime.",2017-08-05 00:00:00

23andMe,,What a waste of money,R. Lloyd,,,272,1.0,"What a waste of money! First you are prompted to answer a bunch of questions regarding your family medical history, which I did. Then you are prompted to answer a bunch of other questions what are then ""determined"" when you get your test results. ""Surprisingly"", my DNA results indicated that I didn't have the markers for any of the diseases that I marked as negative when I filled out my questionnaire. Your ancestry will then be grouped so broadly that it won't answer any of your questions. I'm ""European""? Not a big surprise. I'm also"" British and Irish"", which they grouped together. I wanted a test that would break the results down specifically. ALSO the test results were completely OPPOSITE of the results from the National Geographic DNA test, which broke everything down. I got MUCH, MUCH, MUCH more information from the National Geographic DNA test which breaks down the routes your ancestors took then this 23 and ME test which basically parroted back the info that I answered on the initial questionnaire.

So I would recommend it as a tool to help you in your journey. My only advice, if you and siblings do this together, if your parents are living .....ask them if there is anything that may come up ..... dna doesn't lie. So if there are any secrets that have been kept for years they may come out! As my brother and I found out. We are in our 50s and our Mother was a very good secret keeper!",2017-05-18 00:00:00

23andMe,,Disappointed with my experience!,Susan Roncevich,,,1,1.0,"I am very disappointed with 23 and Me. I have tested with other companies prior to purchasing the 23and Me DNA Test - Health + Ancestry. I had good results from the other DNA tests but I wanted to test with 23and Me for the Health reports. I purchased my kit on 11/24/17 and received the test kit on 11/29/17. The kit was received at their lab on 12/6/2017. On 2/18/18 I received an email stating “our laboratory attempted analysis of your saliva sample but the concentration of DNA was insufficient to produce genotyping results”. They sent a replacement kit on 2/20/2018. They received my second saliva sample in their lab on 03/01/2018. I did this time reach out to their Customer Service Department a few times regarding the status of my test as I was not feeling too confident in them at this point. As suspected, I received an email on 4/2/2018 stating “They could not successfully analyze the second saliva sample for the same reason that produced the first analysis failure, the concentration of DNA in the saliva sample was insufficient.” They would not send another kit but they would refund my money. My frustration with them is that I had sent a saliva sample to another company and they were able to extract my DNA with no problems. I originally never thought of the possibility that the test would fail. I was shocked. I do not recommend the 23andMe DNA Test!",2018-04-21 00:00:00

They received it and it passed quality inspection on December 9th. I patiently waited for almost eight weeks without an update from 23andMe on the status before I contacted customer service. On my first call I was informed by the representative that there was nothing that he could do until the eight weeks had past. I called back after the 8 weeks had passed and was told that they would create a ticket to have a special team that handles these type of requests investigate and provide me with an updated status. Almost another week went by without a status update so I called customer service again. I am currently on hold and have been for the past 25 minutes waiting to speak to a supervisor.

It doesn't matter how good their product is. Their customer service is awful and this is no way to run a company!

Please don't sell on third party sites if you can't back up accidents.

23andMe,,Communications Issue/ Careful With Box Opening,katanaguy,,,10,2.0,"This is sort of a pre--review....I will explain why. I had received my package and so far have 2 areas that I must say 23andMe needs to change ASAP 1) Directions say it normally takes 2 to 5 minutes to spit into the accompaning tube the amount of saliva needed to test, well it was taking me a longggg time and was going to ask if I could sit tube down for a while and come back a little later when my mouth saliva would ""reactivate"" as I call it to do this..... so I called their customer service # for suggestions and an answer. 2) their ""phone reps"" are very, very hard to understand--the 2 diff reps I had anyway were foreigners and I struggled to get understanding to simple questions I had. On my 1st call to them it was so bad I politely asked for someone who spoke better English and the rep hung up on me.....so I called back....2nd guy was just a little better...not much.....AND they try to TALK OVER YOU...they need to slow down and LISTEN TO THE CALLER...... and I could tell they are reading FROM SCRIPTS IN FRONT OF THEM. I have no doubt they DO NOT work only for taking 23and Me calls, but prob are phone reps for many other even totally unrelated co's as well. That is the way it is done now- when these reps take a call and then find out what product you are calling about, they just quickly pull up on their screens that particular phone script for that product from the co you are calling about. I do want to say I do not have any grudge against any foreign person it is just frustrating that 23and Me cannot give us better English speaking people....I sure hope it is not the same if I call back in future for further questions about results once completed. So, I finally got the sample just now mailed back to them and will await the results....One......OTHER VERY IMPORTANT NOTE HERE...When you receive the smallish box in mail, DO NOT just rip it open...be very careful opening because it is the same box you will use to send in your saliva sample- the pre-paid postage paid label is on back of that box....so BE CAREFUL WITH IT. Hope my early comments will help some of you-- it is not an overall review of their service of testing and receiving results. I will post another review once all is completed.",2017-12-02 00:00:00

What is correct is utterly useless information that I ALREADY KNEW ABOUT MYSELF because a MIRROR was invented for some time now. The ""health"" information is just stupid and most of it is information about health in general that they use to fluff up and pad their report to justify your cost. Want to know how trivial and useless? Here are some of my results all bunched together:

Asparagus Odor Detection-->Likely can smell(WTF?); Bald Spot-->Likely no bald spot(Wrong!Unfortunately); Earlobe Type-->Likely detached earlobes(Correct!And I really hate it when I lose one of my detached earlobes.I look funny all day.); Early Hair Loss-->Likely no hair loss(Wrong!Again!Just started Minoxidil;Crossing fingers); Earwax Type-->Likely wet earwax(I guess so.Can't compare to what dry is and don't want to find out); Eye Color-->Likely brown or hazel eyes(Correct!); Finger Length Ratio-->Likely ring finger longer(Wrong!It's my middle finger.Which is currently raised high at 23andMe for fooling me into paying this much money for useless info.); Freckles-->Likely little freckling(Correct!); Hair Texture-->Likely straight or wavy(Correct!Hmmm... straight or wavy? That's kind of hedging a little and covering all the bases there.Oh, right, forgot there's curly too.My bad.); Back Hair-->Likely little upper back hair(Correct!); Bitter Taste-->Likely can taste(Correct!); Cheek Dimples-->Likely no dimples(Correct!); Cleft Chin-->Likely no cleft chin(Correct!); Light or Dark Hair-->Likely dark(Correct!Truly Impressive.Getting the correct answer on 50/50 odds ... 23andMe would make a killing in Las Vegas, baby!); Newborn Hair-->Likely lots of baby hair(Correct!My mom called me 'Her Little Sasquatch. Just kidding.); Photic Sneeze Reflex-->Likely photic sneeze reflex(WTF?Never happened before.But I do sneeze like hell on the disco dance floor!); Red Hair-->Likely no red hair(Correct!); Skin Pigmentation-->Likely lighter skin(Correct!);Sweet vs. Salty-->Likely prefers salty(It's a coin toss here.I'm chubby and have high blood pressure.); Toe Length Ratio-->Likely second toe longer(Correct!So that's why I stub that toe all the time.It's my genetics!); Unibrow-->Likely at least a little unibrow(Yeah, okay, okay, you got me. My secret's out. So I pluck my eyebrows a little. Manscaping is not a bad thing); Widow's Peak-->Likely no widow's peak(Correct!)

The one star is for the only thing I found interesting which is the heritage section. Most I already knew but some of the details I didn't know. I thought I was Chinese, Japanese, Portuguese, and Hawaiian. Now I know not only am I Chinese, Japanese, Iberian(Portuguese), Oceanian (Hawaiian), but also South East Asian (Filipino), Korean, Mongolian, and Finnish!

I really feel more like I paid them to collect information on me and build their database than as if I were getting something of value for money spent. Maybe they are fine but as I put the small pieces together, I don’t trust them. There are also some very long and impractical to read disclaimers and things you need to agree to before submitting the sample. If I knew I would have to agree to very long and complicated legal documents, I would not have purchased this kit. After continuing with this kit, I don’t trust 23 and me.",2017-12-20 00:00:00

I have a olive brown skin tone and light brownish, greenish eyes. I was super excited when I had the chance to do this 23 and me DNA test.I now had a chance to learn about me through genes and with DNA. Here is how it works, open up the package, take out the tube, the instructions are straight froward just remember not to eat or drink 30 minutes before you take the test. 23 and me did a great job explaining the use on the box. Back to the process, fill the tube up to the line with your saliva, press down on the cap firmly. The first cap on the tube is filled with liquid, that is released upon pressing down, this mixes with your saliva, shake, place new cap on tube, seal in bag, place in box and send it off. Pretty simple, it wasn't hard at all but you have to send it by FedEx. After three weeks or so I got my email, stating my DNA results were in. What I discovery shock me! According to the DNA test I wasn't 100% African, I was 78% African, 16.5 European and bunch of other stuff. I spent days reading it over and over again. The best part is the relatives feature, this allows you to find other people who share your genetic traits, Second cousin and thirds cousin all can be found there. The Kit is well worth the money, even if you already heritage, it also offers a wellness report. This report shows if you are a carry of certain diseases. The report study your genes and point out if you are lactose intolerant, if you sleep well, muscles type and much more. This alone is worth the money, very important if you plan on having kids,or dealing with a mystery illness, it could help answer questions. Five stars all the way a must have.",2016-10-26 00:00:00

23andMe,,Not want I paid for,Amazon Customer,,,5,1.0,"Firstly, I paid the higher price to have the health screening done, it took me months to decide if I wanted this due to having family medical conditions. When I got my results back there is no medical history and they said that I did not pay for this. But they are happy to give me the results if I pay $120 more...

I also do not trust my results at all. There results that are coming up are showing me only one last name ( out of 977 results) that is familiar on my list of relatives. It’s Clark. It doesn’t show that I have any Native American or Scottish ancestry even though my mom is atleast 80% Scottish.

It took three weeks to get the test back (end of June) when I was expecting it in August. I called the help line and it goes straight to a man in India that barely could understand me and said there is no way any mistakes could be made. He yelled this at me after I questioned him.

I mostly took this test to get the health results. I know my family and I know up to third cousins on almost all the branches. I’m German Scottish English and Irish With a pinch of Native American.

23andMe,,*UPDATE - better service than I had imagined,Scott Zimmerman,,,7,4.0,"I realize that my main beef with this kit was actually 'our' fault, but my wife went through the instructions, spit in the tubes, boxed them up and then sent them off - before realizing that the only way to connect her sample with her online account was a number that was on the tube itself. The number is not printed/posted anywhere else, and if you didn't create your account and register your number BEFORE you send off the sample, you just flushed $150 down the drain. There is no way for them to link that sample to my wife any more.

Apparently this is a very common issue, as on their website they listed it specifically on their Accounts and Registration FAQ (""What should I do if I sent my sample to the lab before registering it?), yet they still can't be bothered to put the bar-code on anything you aren't sending back to them.

This is NOT a problem if you order directly from the company, because then they have an email address they can contact you at but when purchased through a third party like Amazon you are simply SOL.

*UPDATE - after contacting 23andMe directly via their website and explaining my problem/frustration, they were able to furnish me a brand new kit at no addition cost to ourselves so long as I could prove my original Amazon purchase (which I did). Thus, while my overall complain still stands that they should close the loop on this very obvious and frequent issue of people sending in the kits without registering them first at least they made good on our mistake and we're eagerly awaiting the results of the new, registered kit.",2017-12-19 00:00:00

-Took me 4 weeks to get my results. From what I read online, this varies greatly from person-to-person. You can check the status online after you register your kit. The DNA extracting step took the longest (about 2.5 weeks). Most other steps took about 2-3 days.

ANCESTRY RESULTS:
-I found out I was European, as I expected! It does not give you very detailed countries, but it does provide you with countries that are included in the given groupings. This makes sense because its hard to separate countries from each other when they are so close. I used the information, along with what I knew about my family history, to interpret what the countries in the grouping are likely to be.
- I also thought it was neat they test for neanderthal genetics, which I supposedly have! 23 and me said I have more genetics than over 51% of people who've done 23 and me. Don't know what that means really, but it is cool!

HEALTH RESULTS:
-I only had a ""slight risk"" for one and no variants detected for another, which was nice to see. I ended up paying 5$ for Promethease as well, which told me I also had a slight elevated risk for the same thing as 23 and me. It did, however, note that I may have some variants that 23 and me said I did not have, which left me a bit confused. Promethease is WAY more information (and health variants it looks at) and it is much harder to read, so I liked having both to compare.

OVERALL:
-Overall, I thought it was fun. I got this for a Prime Day deal so it was 1/2 off. Don't know if I'd pay full price for it, but for the deal I got, I thought it was fun and good overall! Just know you'll have to interpret your results with family history you know, in order to get more specific results. For me, it just validated what I already knew. Definitely something worth trying, especially if its on a sale.",2017-08-20 00:00:00

I called and they said they estimate 50% of my DNA ...YET they estimate her to have 33% of Italian heritage from me! How can that be if they lowered me to 24% that would give her 12% not a higher estimate! This makes NO SENSE!!! If you do decide to do a test do them separately and KEEP THEM SEPARATE DO NOT COMBINE.

23andMe,,"Results may or may not be significant, but fun to play around",BadgerBadgerBadger,,,7,5.0,"I've been wanting to try 23andMe for years now, but it got more expensive right at the time that I decided to go ahead. So I was waiting and waiting for some sort of sale, and I was thrilled to come across this at a discount on Amazon Day. The collection process was very easy -- just spit into a tube, follow their directions to shake it up and cap it off, and use their prepaid mailer to drop it into the mail. Unfortunately, after waiting 4-6 weeks for results, I got an email saying there wasn't enough DNA in my sample to run the test. That's rare, but it can happen. If it does, they send you a new collection kit and run it again at no charge. If they can't perform the test on that second try (even more rare, but that can happen too), they refund your money. I did some internet research before the second try, and this time I chewed and chewed on the inside of my cheek to try to slough off enough cells to provide the DNA. Was nervous during the wait for results, but the second time worked like a charm! I was grateful to 23andMe for providing such good service in terms of the re-test.

As for results, my nationality report was not interesting in any way, but I didn't really expect that. I'm 99.9% northern european, which came out as 50% ""generic European"" and smaller percentages that could be matched to specific countries. The specific countries matched exactly with what I would have expected based on my grandparents' heritage. The website lists registered users with related genetics (you can choose whether or not to appear in those listings), and there was nothing terribly exciting, but there was a 2nd cousin whose family names included my grandmother's (very unusual) maiden name, so that was kind of cool. I really signed up largely for the raw data to use in analyzing my health reports. The actual 23andMe genetic health report was fairly skimpy compared to the number of potential mutations out there, but they did correctly identify one significant mutation (Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency) that I already knew results for from a past genetic test. Haven't explored the condition information available on the 23andMe website, but I know that there is some. I've been using a 3rd party site (Livewello, paid but relatively inexpensive) where you upload your raw data from 23andMe and then can find out results for 1,000+ specific bits of genetic material. In my case, no incredibly useful results but it has been great fun to play around with!",2017-10-16 00:00:00

It took the Human Genome Project $2.7 billion and 18 years to sequence the first human genome.

Thank you for your reply. At this time, we are unable to provide a specific timeframe of when this system upgrade will be completed within our laboratory.

Due to this system upgrade, we are unable to accession kits at this time. A kit is marked as ""received"" by our system when it is physically opened at the lab and the kit barcode is scanned - this process is referred to as accessioning. In order to scan the barcode of each sample kit as received, this upgrade must be completed. We hope to upgrade our system within the next few weeks and accession your sample kit as soon as possible.

We know our customers are excited to receive their results and we strive to deliver them as soon as possible, while still meeting our quality standards.

The upgraded reports told me such amazing things like I probably don't have a widows peak in my hair and my ear lobes might be detached. The health recommendations were earthshattering insights like ""avoid fast food"" and ""exercise.""

The extra reports were immediately sent after my payment; no extra work needed to be done. I excitedly dug into the new info and, after being disappointed, filled out an online form to request a refund an hour after my purchase.

I got an email response saying they couldn't take back my access to the new reports on their website so they wouldn't be able to issue a refund because they started what reports were included. They did not say how useless the info was in those reports though.

If you are considering purchasing, just get the ancestry reports and save your money from the other reports.

Update: After disputing the charges with PayPal, 23andme offered to give a refund if both the health report upgrade and the original kit that I was happy with but took away access to the info from both.

The test results were very close in percentages to my Ancestry DNA test (within 5-7% of each other). I really liked the health aspect of this test and found it interesting. (luckily, I am negative for all that worried me) I do like that in the results I can select and compare selected people with others linked to my DNA which helped me to determine which ancestral line they come from. I also found it fascinating that it linked me to others who are descendants of the Mayflower but cousins removed many times over. Having researched my ancestral history already gave me an advantage in that I recognized some of the last names of people in the results with whom I am related to from many generations ago!

23andMe,,The gift that keeps on giving,Leslie G,,,1,5.0,"This a such an awesome company and awesome product. My husband and I did this our selves to learn more about our health and family history back in Dec last year. The box and instructions come quickly, very easy to read and follow what you should do and mail back just from your mailbox. We opened our boxes and followed the instructions to register our individual kits online in our names then followed the steps of how to provide the saliva sample (super easy) and then sealed the packages back up and put in the mailbox to get sent off. My results came back very quickly 4 weeks while my husbands took the few more weeks. The website is easy to follow and they make your results easy to read. We love that there are so many tests and features covered and easy to chose how to share your information and with whom. Since receiving our results over 6 months ago we have bought 2 more kits to start getting grandparents done and they have enjoyed completing and receiving the information as well. The best part is they continue to use your sample for new health and genetic tests/reports so every few months we get an alert that new reports are available. It really is the gift that keeps on giving since we continue to get new reports on new traits and health risks , but we have been able to share our reports with grandparents now and learn information about our family and our selves. We have even started some contact with possible distant cousins. We love this company and how easy it is to use and strongly recommend the Health+Ancestry box to everyone and will continue to gift to our family members!",2018-08-10 00:00:00
23andMe,,"Surprising, but in a good way.",cicisbo,,,1,4.0,"The Pro's

I'll admit, I was hesitant to purchase this item considering the multitude of bad reviews. However, I'm adopted, and the idea of trying to get some semblance of my origins, and whether or not there are any variants in my DNA that could result in cancer, Alzheimer's, etc, has been burning my brain for years. I already knew that I'm part South Korean, but the DNA test elaborated further on unknown factors. It included a mapping of all other areas of my ancestry, such as being British and Irish, as well as having other EuroAsian ancestry. It relieved my fears of possibly getting cancer or Alzheimer's via genetics. So, all in all, it gave me the pertinent information I was curious about.

The Cons

Yes... it does take an excruciatingly long time to receive your results. My saliva sat in some warehouse for three weeks before being processed; which took another three weeks. The results do send back a lot of extraneous information (trait reports) that may or may not be relevant. For example, mine said that I don't have dimples. I have one. I also apparently have very little freckles... Really? Because I can literally map out constellations on my freckly face. I have misophonia.. Wait... what? I don't like chewing sounds?! That's just bizarre, because I don't know how you can come to that conclusion based on my saliva sample. At any rate, there are some quirks to this test, but for people curious about knowing their roots, it really isn't that bad of a product. It's nothing Earth shattering or shocking when you get your results back, but as of yet, I have no regrets purchasing this product.",2018-09-07 00:00:00

They wanted to test my cognitive abilities, which would not run on my Apple Mac. Thus, only 34 of 39 categories were answered. The full test would have taken longer. Who benefits from all my data input? I seriously doubt you will.

23andMe,,"Great product, Customer service lacking",Kray-Z,,,1,4.0,"So I bought this on the Amazon Prime day special. Instructions were easy enough, (Need more spit that you would think... lol) Registration is a bit involved but thorough and easy enough. Now here is where it gets a bit crappy. 23andme outsources the testing to LabCorp (for multiple and legit reasons that is actually beneficial to you the customer) though they had some security issues that required some down time which meant some holdups on processing, some redirecting of packages to another lab, etc... though they are horrible about communicating these delays and just give you cookie cutter responses instead of an honest explanation as to what is going on. If you ever need to call them you get outsourced call service which I honestly did not even waste my time with and automatically asked for someone in the states. Luckily my sample only ran in to two delays, both of which were fixed within about a week each so not as horrible as some other people. Do expect this to take the full 6-8 weeks they ask for though you might get lucky and get it in 4. They do seem to have resolved their issues though and are catching back up so this may no longer be an issue. Do I still recommend this? Yes if you have patience and time to let the sample run its course how ever long it takes. The results are awesome. If you need quick turn around time though I hear ancestry.com DNA is significantly faster.",2018-08-28 00:00:00
23andMe,,privacy issues,C.E.L.,,,4,3.0,"Got the kit. Everything well set up and easy to do. HOWEVER! When I went to register the kit I found extensive tracking and sharing of personal data. I am not referring to the medical data. I presume that's fairly safe but the tracking devices to be installed on my computer for advertisers and general information collection about my personal interests and habits I found to be horrific. I am NOT a whiz with computers so that makes me all the more uneasy. We have ample evidence of how language is 'spun' to make things seem innocuous when they are in fact invasive. If this doesn't bother you, then the process should be fine. But it does bother me and now I am out all that money because I prefer my privacy.

One more thing I would like to add. The site could have provided an option to opt out of various sharing and tracking of my activities. Instead it included information of how I could go to different browser settings and delete cookies and subroutines they inserted into my computer. This sounds good EXCEPT two 'details'. Not only does it (1) put the burden on YOU to adjust settings (multiple steps) for each browser (I have Explorer, Chrome Google and Bing) but a further later disclaimer said that (2) (if I understood it correctly) indicated that every time I went to their web site, I automatically left permission for them to reinsert all over again and I would have to repeat the whole process again to retain my privacy. This is marketing and advertising information and general data collection and these routines are inserted into my computer so they don't end when I leave their website (they said so).",2018-08-15 00:00:00
23andMe,,23 Not for Me,MechC,,,23,2.0,"The ancestry report is pretty vague. I have waited to find out some specifics on heritage but 23andme does not answer those questions. My family could never tell me if I was Czech or Hungarian. Turns out I'm Eastern European. Only the weatherman can have such little accuracy and still have a job. Same thing on my wife's report. Ambiguous reports about being Northern Western European. Apparently French and German are the same thing, not a very satisfying result.

The health and genetic traits are interesting but still not quite scientific break through. I am glad I don't have to worry about Parkinson's or Alzheimer's but I already have a lactose intolerant test, drink a glass of milk and walk around with a stomach ache.
The science is fascinating but leaves much to desire.

23andMe,,Interesting ancestry and valuable health info,George Gilman,,,2,5.0,"I've wanted one of these kits for years but didn't particularly care for the cost so when I saw it for half off on Amazon Prime day, I snapped it up.

The process was quite simple and everything was included. Simply spit into a little cup, toss the pre-paid box into the mail and wait. The waiting period is the hard part as it does take several weeks but well worth it when you receive the results.

Personally, the ancestry portion is interesting but not overly valuable. I verified the origin countries I've been told since childhood were pretty much right with no major surprises but that's about it. I was more interested in the health portion (not a carrier for anything and shouldn't go bald. Yay!) and the ability to further analyze the data by exporting the raw 23andme data into other apps.",2017-08-16 00:00:00

We never really knew my ethnicity, other than ""Scandinavian."" Also, it provides a lot of the likelihood of many health issues and propensities. Some of the information is fairly trite, like needing to eat healthy and exercise, but that doesn't diminish the really helpful and informative things.

I have good friends that have done this as well, and they too found that their ancestry was different from the ""family lore.""

23andMe,,Best DNA Kit Out There,Michigan Family,,,75,5.0,"Buy one for yourself, your spouse, and at least every living parent and grandparent. Once your parents and grandparents are gone, you will lose the ability to easily sequence their genome. The information you receive is awesome. I have connected with many distant relatives and most recently, connected with a third cousin that filled in many blanks I had on my genealogy chart.

I was lucky enough to get in on this when medical information was available. Hopefully one day the FDA will pull their heads out from the sand and allow this turned back on for new users again.

All the negative reviews on Amazon are ridiculous: ranging from not being allowed to return the kit after the company's STATED 30-day return policy and not being able to locate your parents. Read the 1-star reviews carefully. They are ridiculous.

The company, customer service, product, and accessibility to the research and data are impeccable! I have DNA kits from both ancestry.com and 23andme. I don't even use the ancestry.com service because it is not user-friendly and caters mostly to those that pay their ridiculous membership fees. I only bought the ancestry.com kit just so that i have my DNA on another service to increase my chances of finding more relatives.

23andMe,,Sharing profiles horribly broken. Forced to share all information or none.,abc,,,5,1.0,"Somehow this site is still broken even after I brought it to 23andMe's attention 8 months ago. With the heightened attention to people having control over their private data, you'd think 23andMe would wake up and fix things, but alas, they continue their amateur ways. I currently manage 3 different profiles, my own plus one for each of my parents. All 3 profiles are under one account for simplicity and because I actually thought 23andMe knew what they were doing and thought things through. However, I was completely wrong. As it stands, there is no way to have separate sharing settings for each profile. If I share my information with one person, they get access to all three profiles. If I remove a connection from a profile, it gets removed from all three profiles. Seems pretty asinine to me and means there isn't really 3 separate profiles, but 1 single profile with the DNA information of 3 individuals. Just because I want to share my own information with a friend doesn't mean I would want to share my parents' information nor would they want me to share that information. However, that is my only option. It's completely befuddling as to who would ignorantly think this is how it should be, but apparently someone thought it was. This is quite indicative of the disconnect between 23andMe, its clientele, and the intended usage of their site. Until they fix this patently absurd oversight, I would steer clear of 23andMe. They need to get their act together first. Been around for years and can't get the basics correct? Seriously? Go with AncestryDNA.

After sending in our saliva samples it took about six weeks to receive our results back (longer than we expected) but that was probably due to everyone else buying their kits on the exact same date as us.
We have really enjoyed seeing all of our DNA results, viewing the data visualizations and online articles, and participating in research studies. If you can get your siblings, parents, grandparents, etc. to get their own kits it's even more fun to compare everybody's results with the tools provided online. In comparison to similar services offered through other companies, 23andMe is much more detailed!

they have updated it since she initially got her results back and they have changed. she also has new health updates. my whole family wants to get one so we can all do it so our results are more accurate. if my parents both did it and we connected the accounts (which you CAN) then you will get the most accurate results as you have your parent's DNA.

In the meantime, this is our story so far: Ordered two kits and received them in a couple of days, followed instructions to the letter and mailed the kits back Jan 2nd. Pretty easy. When registering the kits, a 'profile' questionnaire came up with pretty in-depth personal questions. Only one of us tried this. After 10 minutes it was taking too long, so exited. Followed the kits on USPS tracking. Both kits arrived at USPS' Los Angeles transfer station later that week, but every day it said 'delivery delayed'. On Jan 11 emailed 23andMe asking if this kind of delay was normal. Received a response same day saying that this was normal, that USPS handles 23andMe packages differently than other kinds of mail and that samples mailed from within the United States typically reach the lab within 2-4 weeks, that we'd receive an email when their lab scans our kit bar code, and to request another kit if we didn't hear from them in 4 weeks. Didn't make sense that it would take 2-4 weeks to deliver the parcel to 23andMe when it had safely arrived in L.A. within a few days, so looked for other feedback sites. Quite a few stories said they'd been told their first sample could not be tested and they were sent another kit. Some say they were advised the second kit apparently wasn't able to test either.

I was excited to find things in my ancestral past that I didn't expect, and I was thrilled to find variations in my genetic DNA that I was hoping would answer some family health history questions. 23 and Me does a great job of making some of the information user friendly to view, but it's not as easy to dig into your past or answer specific genetic questions. For that I had to download my genome file and upload it to genetic genie and then research each variation. I bought this kit on Amazon Prime day, so for half the regular price I'm thrilled with the value. I couldn't get myself to pay the full price though, and I hope in the future they make the cost a little more accessible to everyone. I haven't tried to figure out how to link up with distant family members (although I apparently have over 1,000 in there), so I don't know how it compares to Ancestry in that regard. I will dig into that next because now we're all interesting in looking into our full family tree!
Edited to add: just found out that 23 and Me changed their reports as of August, so I didn't get every genetic variant I would have liked to see. So, we'll be ordering our future family tests from Ancestry, where they are also much less expensive.

23andMe,,Great for finding DNA relatives; Health & Ancestry location reports have a long way to go,RC,,,2,4.0,"I am leaving this review so people know what to expect from this test. It is great if you are trying to identify your birth relatives or find missing relatives. Unfortunately, they just deleted all anonymous relatives from your report, so that makes it a little more difficult - you can't even contact them anonymously anymore to see if they might help you. We did find a lot of relatives on my mom's side though who could help us identify her father after a lot of work. With more and more people taking the test, this will get easier as the database grows. Here is my experience with ancestry locations. My mom and I both took the test and are in the database. When I got my own results, they were about what I expected since I had been researching the family history for years. They did not show any Native American ancestry though. Once I linked my record to my mom's, the ancestry changed, skewed a little more towards my mom's side. My dad didn't want to test. Since I am mostly European, I took a much more expensive and comprehensive European test at DNA consultants. They use Codis, the same database the FBI uses. I got a much more comprehensive breakdown of my European ancestry and my native American ancestry showed up on their test. Now none of these tests is perfect. They pick up deep ancestry, and they get better over the years as more people join the database. If you have a lot of UK ancestry like I do, they may identify you as part Scandanavian due to the Viking invasions. Since populations have become increasing mobile, and races mixed, I can't see how these can ever be completely accurate unless you also have a lot of ancient DNA in your database. They do have some. They can tell you how much Neanderthal dna you have for example, which is fun to know, though not really useful. Just take it all with a grain of salt. Also it is possible to be descended from some races and not have enough dna for them to show up on the test. As for the health reports: they test for some variants of some diseases. But not all variants of those same diseases. So the info is useful to have, but very incomplete. It is useful for you and your doctor to know if you have markers from both parents for a particular disease, but often all you can do to help prevent getting these diseases is to have your doctor watch for them, then eat right and exercize. Which you should be doing anyway to help prevent any disease. Some of the minor things on my report such as likelihood of flushing or having freckles were dead wrong. Maybe i had those genes, but they weren't very active in me or something. Hair, eye and skin color were correct for both of us. Again, for some of these things, they rely on questionnaires which most of the test takers don't even answer. Then if you have the same marker as some people who say they flush easily, then they say you are likely to flush easily. Maybe these parts of the report will become more accurate with more people in the database. But it relies too much on people bothering to answer questions about themselves and answering honestly. To sum up: There are better tests out there for health markers and ancestry composition. It is fine for locating DNA relatives. If you want to locate more DNA relatives, you have to take the test with all the major companies or upload your info. Also, they trashed the family tree portion of this database. When I first joined, I entered all my family tree. Then they made me upload it to myheritage.com. Then they disconnected from myheritage.com so that was all a waste of time. Now it looks like they may be reconnecting again. Anyway, if you want your dna linked to your family trees - just go directly with ancestry.com and skip this company.",2018-09-19 00:00:00
23andMe,,"The Ancestry is worth it, but not so much the health piece",Ashley JJ,,,0,4.0,"The ancestry data is very interesting and I feel it's worth getting the $99 kit. I was able to learn a lot about where my ancestors are from. I was also matched with a lot of potential relatives, no first or second cousins yet though. My friend and her brother both did it and it matched them as siblings, so if you were ever doubting that they actually map your DNA, there is a little proof.

For the health and trait piece, I feel it was not really worth it. The results were very back and forth. I received a lot of conflicting results like ""you're at a high risk for XYZ"" and then another area would say ""you're at a low risk for XYZ."" HUH?

23andMe,,The missing pieces...,Karyl,,,2,4.0,"Although I love my adopted family dearly, as an adoptee there have always been huge chunks of the puzzle that is 'me' missing and living in a still closed adoption state I spent most of my life wondering about my biological side and envying those who could say for sure they were X,Y,Z. In my late 50s now and having run this concept past my now in his 90s adopted dad and hearing he's very okay with it (and with this having gone on sale :-D ) I finally decided to 'go for it' and can now say that having this done was one of my better decisions. It has helped me fill in those gaps a bit (and has even very cautiously started me on a journey that may help me know a bit more of my biological family's story and sooth a lifetime of yearning to know).

It was interesting to learn that although I'm heavily Caucasian I also have Hispanic and somewhere in the past few hundred years one of my ancestors was a POC from Africa.

The Neanderthal info was fun and researching more about how this now extinct branch lived and possibly helped Homo sapiens is pretty fascinating but I'm a bit of an info junkie. :-D

As for the company and kit itself... The kit was well packaged and the instructions easy to follow. It took less time to process than they said but it still 'feels' like a long time when you're waiting excitedly. I find the 23andMe website fairly easy to navigate and informative but would like to see more 'bang for the buck' or a lot less 'buck' as a regular price. If I had paid full price instead of half I'd have been much more disappointed.

Overall I'd recommend the company and having the test done. FWIW, If you're a fellow adoptee or birth family member of one interested in connecting, I highly recommend using BOTH this 'and' Ancestry, downloading your 'raw data' and uploading it to a few of other DNA family tree sites (who are free or very inexpensive for uploading raw data to) to find the most possibilities. :-)",2017-09-15 00:00:00

And if you want to know even more about yourself, you can upload the raw data from your results to third party websites that break things down even further.

I might have been more interested if it showed my DNA has a propensity for certain diseases.
I did think the ability of connecting with relatives for the sake of enhancing family tree information was a plus, but out of a FIFTY page report (that included way too many neanderthal era facts), I found THREE pages worth printing for future reference.",2018-12-30 00:00:00

Long story short I did not test positive for the health risks. Then I read the fine print that says that the test only works on people with Jewish DNA.

I purchased the Ancestry.com test years ago and found out after taking the 23 and Me test that you receive much more value with the Ancestry.com test. I ran the Ancestry.com results through a free online algorithm that gave me the health risks. The free website offered the same and substantially more information than the 23 and Me report. I ordered the 23 and Me test specifically for the health risks profile. It is totally worthless for the majority of customers. After you pay for the test, they tell you that it is only relevant to people with Jewish DNA (see attached screenshots).

My health report showed that I don't have any of the genetic markers for Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, etc. The only one I have genetic markers for is Age Related Macular Degeneration.

I would say that for $200 everything was worth it for me; and I will be getting another one for my wife to do.

23andMe,,Nothing I didn't already know,Amazon Customer,,,2,1.0,"Waste of money. Did not tell me anything I did not already know. I wanted the DNA test mainly to see what genes I have for medical purposes to see what I may be predisposed to. But the only thing 23 and me does is tell you what you DON'T have, and only out of a small fraction of conditions. My whole report just says ""Variant not detected"", which doesn't tell me anything. Very disappointed and would very much appreciate my money back if possible. The only thing this DNA test did was reaffirm that I am European. Nothing medical at all to help me. It tells you non-meaningful traits like if your earlobes are detached, or if you're likely lactose intolerant, which I am, though it says I likely am not- so it's also inaccurate. Things that don't help you understand yourself at all. Why do I care if my earlobes are detached or what type of earwax I have? Yes, this is what you're paying for, to know if you have wet or dry earwax, or if you have a widows peak, things you either don't care about or already know. Would not recommend this at all. As a psychologist, I am considering actual genetic testing by a licensed doctor in my local area to find the results I need, because I am assuming all these at-home DNA kits are the same. They appeal to the novelty, without any of the science. Also looking at Genomind and Genecept Assay because those will tell psychiatrically what medications may be best for mental illness, and I am curious to know if my current mood stabilizer is recommended for me based on my genetic makeup.

My son knows how to spit into a tube!

23andMe,,"Well, thats not at all what I expected.....",HeyLei,,,2,5.0,"My husband recently took this test (because he is adopted) and we wanted to find out more about his ancestry. We found out a pretty detailed break up of his ancestry. Nothing too out of the ordinary of what we already assumed, he's white (mostly Northern European -- Irish British) and is related to some Midieval king. So when the tests were on sale during Amazon Prime Day my husband got one for me to do just for fun. I've basically grown up with the knowledge that I am Filipino (my mom), Spanish, and French (Dad). I wasn't expecting to learn much. Well, I got my results yesterday and within a matter of hours my world was turned upside down. My results were much more complex then I ever could have imagined: East Asian, Native American, Iberian, Italian, African, Ashkenazi Jew, Northern and Southern European, Indian. And then everything else listed after was less than 2% (Oceanic, Middle Eastern, Unassigned, etc) . No French and my mom is obviously not 100% Filipino. I mustered up the strength to share my results with my dad, and he immediately flipped out telling me that the tests were either wrong or my mom basically cheated on him and I'm not his daughter......WTF. My dad was mostly joking, I think. I feel like everything I have ever known has been a lie. Who am I? I have been filling out all my forms out incorrectly...all my life. I'm Italian, which now explains my love for pasta and family loyalty. This is all so much for me to take in. My anxiety is beginning to kick in. Be aware that 23 and Me does warn about the possibility of experiencing ""emotional difficulty"" with regards to learning your results. That's an extreme understatement. Make sure sure you have a good support system in place to help you deal with any surprises that could possibly arise.

Ok, maybe I'm exaggerating this experience slightly, but my dad did say that I'm most likely not his. That part's true. But how cool is it to find out all this new stuff about who I am? I feel like I'm that much closer to gaining a grasp on my true identity. I totally recommend doing this test, what a fun experience.",2017-08-12 00:00:00

I have also used other websites where I uploaded my raw DNA data to get more matches, and more information. I learned that 23andMe tends to miss relative matches in your list of matches, and their health test is a joke! Save your money, and wait until you do just the autosomal test, then upload your raw DNA data to promethease.com or you could get VitaGene. Their testing for both the Ancestry and the health reports is about the same cost as doing just the Ancestry testing. Shop around, ask your friends and family what their experiences were. While 23andMe does have some cool stuff, it really isn't as good as the others.",2017-08-05 00:00:00
23andMe,,Great Product!!!,M. Morris,,,1,5.0,I bought this during Amazon Prime days and it was a great deal. I really like the information.

Telling me I'm likely to have certain traits is not a health report, IMO. The ancestry part did not tell me anything I did not know from my own paper trail research. When you look at your ""results"", it gives you a 50% speculative interpretation. When you change results to the 90% conservative interpretation, your ancestry results change to much less definitive numbers. $199 to find out you are ""broadly"" from one area?

It will take you much longer and by that time, you won't even have any interest left of the result cause you're going to be exhausted and stressed out. Same replies from the customer service that it's a complicated process and even they don't know when the results will be ready. No proper apologies for the delay, just keep on saying be calm and wait for the result. If it's okay for you to pay $130 and get something after 3 months then go for it (could take more than 3 months, who knows). Oh yeah and there are possibilities that your saliva couldn't be analyzed due to ""insufficient amount of data"" which they never will tell you before purchasing. In that case, you have to go through the 3 month process all over again which will roughly be half a year. Good luck with that.",2018-08-07 00:00:00

23andMe,,"Zero star, waste of money, so disappointing.",BJMC,,,59,1.0,"Zero stars. What a waste of money. It told me I was of 100% European background which I already knew, I understood this DNA test would break it down a little more specific, and now it tells me it can't complete my origins without my father or brother's DNA so I would need to buy a whole other kit. I was so excited to get the results only to be so disappointed when they came, it took me about 10 minutes to read all of the details in my report. The result was as follows: (European 100.0%), Northwestern European 95.6%, British & Irish 36.5%, Scandinavian 13.1%, French & German 11.5%, Broadly Northwestern European 34.5%, Southern European 1.4%, Balkan 1.2%, Broadly Southern European 0.2%, Eastern European 1.3% Broadly European 1.6%. It doesn't even break it down to which side my Mom or Dad's it comes from without their DNA. SO not worth it. It reads: To see how much of your ancestry composition was inherited from each of your parents, you must be connected to at least one parent. This simply means one of them must take the DNA test to obtain the results. It states: Paternal haplogroups are families of Y chromosomes that all trace back to a single mutation at a specific place and time. By looking at the geographic distribution of these related lineages, we learn how our ancient male ancestors migrated throughout the world. Share with your brother or father. When this feature is available, you'll receive your paternal haplogroup assignment. It gave me the female side because I'm female.

This DNA test said that she was 84% sub-Saharan African. Wow, ya think? 14% northern European. Gee what a shocker.

We had this fantasy that we'd be told where in Africa, and where in Europe. As it stands, this was $200 of stuff that was obvious.

Quite a number of the physical traits came back similar to the following: 60% chance of no freckles, 40% freckles (actually, freckles). But the percentages are so close it could go either way. Mostly, they erred on the wrong side ... but at 60-40, you aren't getting any real information.

Similarly, you're told your chances of having brown eyes, brown skin, detatched earlobes .... wow it's like we don't need mirrors anymore.

4 stars for the blood collection process.

Improvements would include instructions outside of the box so you can read what the process entails prior to collection. Even if they are printed on the box still sealed.

My biggest issue was the collection vial didn't have a distinct edge/lip where u can scrape the blood off your finger. Mine took 3 pricks before I got good blood flow and by then it was sticky and clotting. I couldn't scrape the blood into the vial bc there was was a thin blood bubble blocking it and blood was running everywhere but into the collection vial. It was a total mess bc of this. However, maybe had I done the prick on the outside of my ring finger first it would have gone a lot smoother and avoiding this issue entirely.

Overall, I would purchase again since the results were accurate in my case.

Tip: With my experience my ring finger, on the side by my pinky in the fatty part, was the best place to prick.

Good Luck.",2018-04-19 00:00:00

23andMe,,Inferior Product Costs Twice the Price,Gothson,,,36,1.0,"After their fallout with the FDA, 23andMe now put out a poor product that costs twice as much as the other two major DNA testing services, the other testing companies being AncestryDna and FamilyTreeDna. It doesn't have much to offer. They used to give a lot of information about medical conditions that one might develop, but after the FDA stopped them from giving medical advice, they have basically come up with a watered down product. I mean, who cares if they tell me I can smell asparagus in my pee or if I have light-colored eyes? I don't need a DNA test for that. I already know that. Tell me something I don't know!

Then regarding the ability to discover extended family members via DNA matches and to confirm various branches in one's family tree, 23andme fails miserably. Privacy settings are the default which results in most people not sharing any family names or trees, and sometimes they are completely anonymous that you don't even know the name of the person you are matching, so you are left in the dark. Gee, your closest match is ""anonymous"". I take that as a giant middle-finger.

It seems they don't really care anymore. They wanted to get a big enough database so that they could sell the data to big pharmaceutical companies, and maybe now they have got what they needed. Well, I would not recommend this company to anyone. Save your money and test yourself at Ancestry or FamilyTreeDna instead.",2016-09-04 00:00:00

23andMe,,"Lost money, unable to register kit, worthless customer service",Emendator,,,27,1.0,"I mean go ahead if you don't believe me, waste your money. These people claim to give you information although if you read their Facebook page, you will learn (in a hard-to-find left sidebar) that many people have communicated the problems they've had.

In my case, I carefully and properly registered the product on their website and received the confirmation email, only to have an email forwarded to me that said the test kit had been received back by 23andme but that there was no corresponding registration. So I went through that process again, again receiving the email that is sent to confirm the registration. Yet again they said there was no registration. I have communicated with them through their customer service email link to no avail. The 23andme customer service people keep emailing that it is customer error when in fact their system is broken. This means that about $110 is lost because there is no way to connect the test kit with me.

Not only are they too arrogant to look for their system failure, they have set up contact by email only. You cannot communicate with these isolated ivory tower people by telephone.

If you've followed the trouble 23andme has had with US FDA, you know that these people were cocky enough to fail to reply timely to the FDA's demands; thus the FDA forced them to stop giving customers ""health-related"" information. That, of course, was one of the reasons customers wanted their DNA tested.

My brother initially paid them $200 for a test and then 23andme came up with a way to extort $200 more out of him if he wanted further results. Just thought you'd like to know this.

Update: The third time I attempted to register this kit it worked and was an entirely different experience although I did exactly what I had done before. Apparently they fixed what was wrong. Now I am attempting to use their system only to find badly designed features that create frustration and waste time. For example, when I want to communicate with another member who is a DNA match, a box comes up for that purpose. However the slightest accidental touch on the screen outside this box causes it to disappear along with all the work that has already been put into the message. Which often is considerable. Also temporary navigation away from the screen, for example to check genealogical information needed in the message, also causes this badly designed message box to abort. Another badly designed feature is that the program requires a sign-in after it thinks that there has been no activity for an hour. However, it doesn't know when you've been hard at work on a message during that time so when you ""send"" the message it makes you sign in again but of course it fails to save the message on which you've spent time and effort.

We know these incompetent design features occur when (1) management that neither understands the intricacies of daily computer use nor actually uses the features gives orders or (2) IT people who design these features fail to understand practical use and then fail to double-check their choices by actually using them, I mean substantial use not just a quick check, are the ones making decisions.

There may also be a CYA culture here. Hard to know.",2015-01-06 00:00:00

This is true for all DNA testing companies when it comes to medical information. The good news is that you can upload your 23andMe data to other websites and receive detailed reports. Promethease.com gives you detailed reporting for just $5 - everything from vulnerabilities to diseases, to genes associated with personality traits. Another commenter mentioned the MTHFR mutations, which are associated with many chronic illnesses. Geneticgenie.org will run your 23andMe results specifically related to these genes, and the report is free. And if you can afford it, the best way to interpret your results is to make an appointment with a genetic counselor, who you can find through NSGC.org.

I did my test with 23andme in 2014 and the results came after about 9 weeks. It was incredible and fascinating to see the information provided in this test and my parents and grandparents always to me I was an equal mixture of English, Scottish and Irish. (Our family names for generations pretty much also reflect the links to Great Britain.) 23andme confirmed what my grandparents on both side of our family had been telling me when I was very young.This was so interesting, that I bought another 23andMe test kit for my wife.

23andme nearly overwhelmed me with information not only in regard to where I came from, but with information about possible health issues I could probably have. I'm about to turn 66 as I write my review, and I'll say looking back at my medical ailments over the years, the health info was about 98% accurate, despite missing multiple sclerosis (which I was diagnosed with at age 60) and 23andme suggested I am prone to psoriasis (which I nor any member of my family has ever had.

My major disappointment with 23andme came earlier this year (2017) when they sent out info stating they were going to be selling my (and everyone else's data) to third party entities. Like Hell, I want my personal information to be sold to a corporation! I sent 23andme an email telling them to drop me as a customer, and that I did NOT want them releasing my personal information to anyone.

About 10 days later I received an email from them staying my account was closed and all I have now are some vague memories of the maps on 23andme showing migration patterns of my ancestors, some recollections of other info and questions as to why long-after I paid my $200, 23andme decided to ""prostitute"" me (and everyone else using their DNA test kit) AFTER I agreed to their original terms back in 2014.

I'd love to meet Anne Wojcicki (CEO and co-founder of 23andme) so I could say to her in my bad impression of Arnold Schwarzenegger voice, ""Hasta la vista baby, I WON'T be back."" And neither will my wife!",2017-08-19 00:00:00

Update. Even thought my claims window with Amazon is closed I'm going to see if there is something they can do. If not my CC gives me a year protection and I'm going to use it. After 3 months I get a notice that my sample wasn't good enough to provide analysis. Do they say they are shipping out a replacement? No, that is what an honest company would do.

My personal experience: Mine wasn't so great. I like the concept of the product/service. So in order to get them your DNA, all you do is spit in a tube and send it off. The issue with me was I guess they couldn't extract enough DNA from my saliva so they couldn't process it. Bummer, right? The good thing is that they give you 2 options, They will send another kit to you for free or refund your purchase. I opted for the new kit. I send in my saliva.

For me, I got 99.9% South Asian. Are you kidding me? I could have said that without a $200 DNA test. For a population of over 1.3 billion people in India alone, 23andme can't find a proper DNA analysis for this population? Are they THAT lazy? For British Isles, or other small islands in Europe they could provide a detailed analysis of it including tiny regions.

I did a Genographic Project DNA test two years ago and that was more detailed that 23andme's terrible DNA result. 40% South East Asian, 30% South West Asian, 14% Mediterranean, 4% Northern European among others. Not only that, I was 2% Neanderthal and 3% Denisovan.

None of these results were on 23andme. Just 99.9% South Asian. I could have looked in the mirror to know that.

Sorry about my language, but that's what it is. A LAZY DNA test. Such a waste of my money and time.

After analyzing the SNP data, 23andMe make information easily digestable by their presentation and graphics. I took mine mainly to get a few laughs about matching up my physical genetics. I want to get my sister one to settle a few bets. I also wanted to see if I was a carrier for any genetic diseases.

23andMe,,Know what your expectations are before you buy,Deana E.,,,2,4.0,"I have seen this and other similar products before but never wanted to spend the money. When this was on the Black Friday deal, I thought 'why not'? I solicited friends and family feedback and I read the reviews, which are over the place. Some people are mad because it got their eye color wrong (Trait Reports), others think there is some conspiracy to get everyone's dna for nefarious reasons, and some even think the results are given to insurance companies! Back to Reality: before you do this, ask yourself what you REALLY want to know and what you expect to get out of this. This is NOT meant to give you definitive health information, but instead tells you if you have any of the genetic markers or variants that they test for; and they only test for SOME, not all. There are Genetic Health Risk reports, Carrier Status Reports, Wellness Reports and Trait Reports in addition to the Ancestry Reports.

Why did I purchase this and what did I like? The ancestry part wasn't a big deal for me. I'm not into genealogy, so it wasn't about finding my heritage, but I was curious if there were any surprises (none). The health component was my primary reason and I read the disclaimers (listed over and over). I found my report to be interesting and it has given me some things to look into for long term health reasons. As for the other reports, it was interesting to read the Wellness and Trait reports, and no, it didn't get everything right, but nor did I expect it to.

I didn't give it 5 stars because it told me I'm likely to weigh more than average! Ha ha ha!! Just kidding -- not about weighing more, that's true -- but that isn't why I didn't give it 5 stars. I'm not sure you could really rate a tool like this 5 stars, but it is something I definitely recommend!

23andMe,,"Interesting, but strange timelines",Cass,,,3,5.0,"Timelines are a little wonky. I sent mine in and it was received December 7th. My husbands was received December 8th. His results came in on around January 15th. I still not have received mine though it is, just barely, still within the timeline of 6-8 weeks.

That said, I've viewed the results for my husband and it's very interesting to look through. I think we knew what we were going to see and weren't surprised to get the results he did. The predisposition to diseases was at least an interesting read, though they stress that environment and other factors play a big role in your chances of actually acquiring any of the mentioned diseases/disorders.

UPDATE: On the first day over 8 weeks, I sent an email to customer support saying that I hadn't seen any progress from essentially step 2 after they receive it and just wanted an update. I received a very courteous response saying that they were moving my sample to the front and that I would be receiving a free code for another kit! I received my results on Feb 14th - almost 10 weeks later. I definitely expected a little delay since I sent in around the holidays and really wasn't in any hurry since the data wasn't going to change, just very curious. I appreciate the fantastic customer service. I've read that people are very frustrated with them when they email before the 8 weeks demanding updates, but that is what the slider on the homepage is for - to provide updates. If it gets past 8 weeks, then ask what's up.",2018-02-01 00:00:00

23andMe,,"Expectations need to be lowered, and some of what is being sold is not accurate.",Dwight G. Chapin,,,21,2.0,"I think my expectations were a little high going into this, which resulted in being unhappy with the overall experience.

Positives: Seeing the connection with family members, including my brother and daughter. I had no doubt of the relationship, but in a strange way seeing the genetic connection felt good.

Negatives:
1: It takes too long to get your result. I understand the testing needs time, and I am sure they have a lot of samples every day. The problem was with how long it took to get from me to the actual testing center. I think the overall time to get my results...that more than half of that time was waiting for the item to ship back. It seemed to get held up at one point for two weeks. This also happened with my daughters sample. It is already a long process which can take over a month, so I don't know why it bottlenecks so much from just shipping alone.

2: I took another test from another company, and found my genetic history to be different. It was not a small difference. After the fact I discovered that each place uses different ways of looking at the DNA which results in a percentages being different. It would not bother me if we were talking a 1 or 2 percent, but one background was 10% different from one test to the other. It feels weird to tell someone I am 30% something when another company says I am 40%. Also, that other company took about half as long from start to finish to get my results.

3: Almost everyone of the results for things like going bald to which finger was longer was wrong. Some of them would even say that there was only a 50ish percent chance you would have this trait or another, which is almost a flip of the coin. That entire section seemed worthless. The few things that were right at first made me think ""Cool"" but after thinking about anyone could have randomly guess about the same number based on no information at all.

4: Because of the above problems with how wrong it was on traits, it made me doubt almost everything other than the fact that it picked out relatives. I paid for the higher priced package, and I think I wasted money doing so.

The bottom line, you need to understand that outside seeing relatives, I don't know how accurate this actually is. If you are thinking of doing this, my recommendation is to save money and get the base test, which at least seems accurate. I think anything more is a waste of money at this time.",2018-07-11 00:00:00

The technology is still evolving. They keep sending updates at the technology advances. I thought I was 100% German and I'm not. I found that out with the other kit as well, but this one added more Eastern European ancestry that the other kit did not. I think it is worth taking both and comparing this with Ancestry.com.

Some of the stuff they test for is kinda quirky and funny (like whether or not you're likely to be able to smell asparagus, or how likely you are to have a lot of hair as an infant). Most things reported were spot on, too. Other things were a little scary to have to wait to find out (Alzheimer's, Parkinsons).

My only advice is, don't bother buying the health part, for which you'll pay extra. I did and it basically told me nothing and it's confusing to say the least.

23andMe,,More compelling results than Ancestry...,C. Okamuro,,,13,4.0,"There are a variety of home testing DNA kits out there, but it feels like 23andMe and Ancestry may be the most popular ones in the US (or at least they appear to be the most heavily marketed). The popularity of the kits is integral with their value in that the larger the customer base (and therefore the pool of DNA results), the more family matches and genome insights you are likely to find. That's the main value in trying more than one kit.

The collection process is not a big deal... a bit of saliva in a tube, a prepaid mailer, and a registration code to match the kit to your online account. Budget a few minutes for all of that, but be sure to follow the guidelines regarding food/gum/beverages. From mailing to receipt of results was about 3 weeks, but your mileage may vary.

I bought the ancestry + health testing, and it resulted in 91 reports (5 ancestry, 43 carrier status, 9 genetic risk, 26 traits, and 8 wellness). Actually, it was significantly fewer, but your your results get updated as 23andMe add new genetic tests and screens. I haven't accessed the results via the web portal, so I can't speak to its interface, but I do use the Android app. The interface of the app works well. Some of the more sensitive test results (like BRCA1/2) are initially put behind a readme layer; you at least have to scroll through the writeup about what the test result means before you can have access to the result.

Because of the health results, I found the overall results to be more interesting than what I got from Ancestry. The genealogy results were similar, but not identical, owing to the different pools of subjects. That's the main reason why I recommend using more than one test... you'll have a better representation of your DNA relatives than if you only use a single provider's test.",2018-07-01 00:00:00

Yet to be fair ancestry DNA results I received were from a few years back and am sure they have collected and are able to perform more details then they had when I used it. I am very excited to see my results with 23and Me and know that the more family that take this DNA or any DNA product the better my over all results will be. I look forward to comparing my results with my nephew and as will be purchasing one for my mother to compare her results with ours.

Why 10 days? I know they do batch testing, but MY sample shouldn't be held up just because some other sample in the batch is having issues, IMO. If there is an issue, I should have heard from them about it.

Their website is a mess!
In the first place, they don't really distinguish, when setting up your account, which questions are required to set up your account and which are voluntary to help them with research. That is frustrating. A person should be able to tend to the important agreements and know they're done with those and that their account is set up before being asked what probably amounts to (not exaggerating) 10-15 hours of health questions.
In any case, realizing that somehow I'd gotten onto that treadmill and it wasn't going to end, I tried over the course of 3 days and put over 8 hours into attempting resolve a website glitch that would allow a person to choose whether they did or didn't want their sample stored for further research.

I had friends over to see if they could figure out the problem. I called and wrote to customer service.- two different branches of the company - and they didn't seem to care. Their customer service is the worst! They just refer you to their website! By the time my sample had arrived at the company, it was too late to change anything (although I did spend another 2 hours trying to do so!)

So, basically, if you're having trouble with the website, they say: Go to the website!

Specifically, I'd say, ""Hey, I'm having trouble with this link. It's not taking me to the page where I can choose to have my sample stored! My friends have come over to see if I'm an idiot or what the problem is, we've spent hours and hours trying to solve this... Here's the browser I'm using, blah, blah..."" and probably no less than 15 times, I was referred to the link that wasn't working, or a different one that linked to it and then asked to rate their customer service!""

Now I know my last DNA Test with Arcpoint Labs was so much better and more meaningful to me. Even Arcpoint labs didn't ask me a single question about my ethnicity besides collecting my saliva only, but the results came out made me happy. They also gave me the Certificate of Ethnicity signed by Genetic doctor. This paperwork shows up my master genes and 18 tiny genes on the list, I am so impressed and proud of this certificate. When I joined 23anMe, they asked me a lot of questions about my races, I thought they got a lot of information from me, so the result should be better than my last test. But on the contrary, when I got the results came out as not I expected, I knew my thought only delusion, so they made me down so much ! I have wasted money for nothing plus sad feeling !",2019-01-04 00:00:00
23andMe,,Worth the price? Maybe...?,E Ray,,,1,4.0,Sending in the dna sample was seamless and easy. Got my results in less than two weeks. The order staus said it was coming a week later but the app displayed my results a week early. My sister sent her sample in on the same day and its just started being processed so looks like not a lot of predicability to the order processing. The results were interesting but not earth shaatrering and not nearly as detailed as inwas led to believed in terms of health outcomes. In fact pretty shallow. Not sure the medical component is worth the money. Ancestry was accurate but no new findings.,2018-12-10 00:00:00
23andMe,,Interesting and entertaining,steph,,,1,4.0,"I've had a passing interest in DNA testing since these kits came out. I chose this company because they also have health testing and because of their sharing policy. After receiving the results I realized the regions are not as comprehensive as those in other tests, so I might try a different one with another company given that they have the same sharing policy. I think the health test is something most people should try, as it lets you know if you could be a carrier and possibly pass something on to offspring. It's nice knowing I don't have to worry about that from my end.",2018-01-06 00:00:00

One for my dad and one for my mother-in-law as Christmas presents. They of course haven’t opened them yet as it’s not Christmas but my father-in-law got one for Christmas last year and he loved/loves it! Every now and then the info that he can access on his phone will grow and give him more info as the technology progresses. It’s so cool! Awesome way to find out more about who you come from. Now that my husbands mom and dad will have done them then their kids won’t have to guess at all about their genealogy as well. How cool! I will update this as I learn more about how it works.,2018-12-03 00:00:00

23andMe,,"One Downside For Women, But Not The Fault Of The Company",Rory Turing,,,0,5.0,"Genetics testing can only track your paternal ancestry if you either have a Y Chromosome, or if you have your father's genetics on record with them as well(ie. he does the test with you, or has done it in the past). For me, being adopted, that means I can't know what my father's side carries, and that is a bit of an issue, considering he is the half that is Native American, and I wanted to know more. I didn't know about that going in, and I am a little sad about that, but the test is amazing, and it's great to know my mother's side anyway. I had no idea I was half Irish. I always thought I was English/German thanks to her. So, I can't knock points off this kit, but I do wish I had known that ahead of time.",2018-12-16 00:00:00

I'm fascinated by my test and look forward to what I might find out about the rest of my family. Always new things happening on the 23andMe website. Most of my ancestry results were as I imagined, except for the surprise of Native American. It lead to genealogical research, and I was able to find my native ancestors in Nova Scotia in the 1600s. I might not have searched were it not for this test.",2018-01-16 00:00:00
23andMe,,Not useful for family tree info.,M.Young,,,0,3.0,"Was a bit disappointed about the information you receive from your results. I was under the impression that it would tell you details on each family member you are related too. It just says ur relationship and how much dna u share. Doesn’t explain how u are related. The health portion was lacking not much useful information. I ened up buying an ancestry dna kit to find more about my family roots and find other family members. The 23&me just tells me where I’m from and few health questions. I wouldn’t recommend it , I was rather disappointed. If ur wanting family connections this isn’t the correct test.",2019-01-06 00:00:00

23andMe,,I TOTALLY believe in this!!!!,AmzCust,,,0,5.0,I think it is great to be able to KNOW instead of stories heard from long ago just exactly where a person comes from! Well worth the money! It is something to also help a person know what kind of medical issues that they MIGHT have. It showed me that I had a certain gene about blood clotting and I did have a blood clot and I am lucky to still be here. There is knowledge now and I am much better off on the right meds!

It only took 9 total days from that Tuesday to get my full ancestry and health. I was pretty shocked it was so quick because the one I did with Ancestry.com took 4 weeks.

I love the app and the fact that you can track your package all the way to the lab, then it checks off each task as it’s finished until your results are in.

This is a great gift!",2018-12-08 00:00:00
23andMe,,Cool idea !,Daryl,,,0,5.0,23 and me is a very useful kit if you want to know about your ancestry and other health issues. Be easy to access kit is simple and the online registration was easy. They don’t make you answer a bunch questions if you don’t want to answer them but they certainly aid in the understanding of your current health and other health issues amongst the general population.

It took about 4 weeks to get the results, including some unexpected ancestry.
It's been truly the ""gift of discovery"" for us.
It was very exciting to uncover our genetic heritage, long-lost second cousins, and obtain some health information.
There is also lot of fluff that is fun to read through and compare with family and friends. (attached ear lobes, ability to taste bitter, etc)
Now, others members of my family also want to get tested :D",2018-01-06 00:00:00

23andMe,,Waste of time and money,SBF,,,5,1.0,"If you know anything about your own health and ancestry, this will not give you any more information and is a waste of money. For the ancestry portion, my mother was an immigrant, so I know that side. As a woman, they gave me no information about my father's side, because I didn't get his Y chromosome. His family has been in the US since the 1600's and I got ZERO information about him.
For the health risks, they didn't tell me anything I don't already know and actually didn't get some things right.
Sure you get plenty of raw genetic data, but there is no way to interpret it. The trait predictions were almost 100% wrong. e.g. I am a redhead and it said I didn't carry that trait. Same for a cleft chin.
800 number provided no help and told me I should do a google search to find someone who could interpret the raw data. REALLY!? What are you charging people for? Don't use this.",2018-05-17 00:00:00

(23 and me lets you accept or decline multiple agreements to store/use your DNA for scientific purposes, if you decline these then they simply dispose of your sample after analysis). Personally I hope I have a clone growing somewhere as that life would be much more interesting than this cattle ranch!!

There’s a line to tell you how much you need to spit and afterwards, you seal it up and mail it off via USPS with a prelabeled package. Results take approximately a month to get back.

I think the turnaround between mailing off my sample and receiving my results was only about 3 weeks. I did expect more from the health results than what I got but it was interesting anyway.

23andme breaks down your genetic percentages from round the world. Not only that, but they can tell you if you have recessive Gene traits and whether they are expressed or not.

23andMe,,Invaluable information,LowCarbLivin,,,3,5.0,"I was able to purchase this for $99 during the 24 hour Black Friday special. I expected it to take much longer to get the results, but it only took about six weeks.

I learned a lot about my ancestry. I had also tried Vitagene, and it was NOT a accurate in terms of ancestry. The results of that were so bad that I wonder if they got my sample mixed up with someone else. 23 and Me is the real deal, and VERY accurate. I discovered I have a bunch of second and third cousins I knew nothing about! And my ancestry reports were spot on from what I’ve been told my whole entire life.

The health portion is interesting. I opted out to learn if I am predisposed to Alzheimer’s or Parkinson’s disease since neither are curable, and life gives us enough to worry about. But it did detect other conditions, one of which I knew I had- a blood disorder (it mentioned that I have an increased risk of developing blood clots- it didn’t mention the name of my disorder though). It also said I am at slight increase of age related macular degeneration. So I am going to be taking lutein and vitamin A now!

It also told me that my middle toe is shorter than my big toe, this isn’t true lol. But everything else was. I am less than average weight with an atheletic build. I am not lactose intolerant, nor am I celiac. A diet high in fat is unlikely to impact my weight unless I exceed my daily caloric intake. You will learn little tidbits like this about yourself that I feel can be very useful! Some of it you will already know- for instance I am not a deep sleeper, but I had no idea that there was a genetic component to this.

I also learned that I have a lot of Neanderthal DNA, which is a bit weird, and I am still not sure what that means. Anyway, this is very interesting and highly recommend!",2018-01-30 00:00:00

He tried to track the genealogy, but couldn't confirm what she said. But she insisted. Who knows who to trust? Trust your DNA!! Very simple spit-in-tube kit. Just remember to tell them to register and to do it for the correct kit. I had to remind my dad, and he had to go back and fix it, as he choose just ancestry at first. Luckily, his kit had not been sent in yet. His medical-ish side told him about a few diet ideas and was positive got a marker for some artery disease, which his EKGs are always borderline, so it's nice to know why and what to pay attention to.

The medical predisposition test was the main reason I chose this kit over the competition, yet they only test for about eight conditions.

I Find it likely that they are not analysing things deeply enough, perhaps using incomplete or misguided datasets. If you must absolutely get a DNA kit, I would suggest trying the competition: it could hardly be worse than this, and at least you will get a more detailed and specific ancestry analysis.

My only disappointment with this product was the service from 23andMe. The customer respresentative was extremely rude when I expressed concern that it seemed like my kit was lost. She just kept repeating her script. When I asked to speak to her supervisor, she asked me why, and then refused to allow me to speak to her supervisor. Then, she yelled at me telling me that I need to wait two weeks more before I can report that my kit is lost. Fortunately for me, the kit was not lost; but, as the far as keeping you posted on when they receive your kit and the status of your results do not really keep you updated because they don’t really update the status (and that is using their app). When you call, you are just told the standard, “you must wait x amount of weeks” before they can tell you anything about your kit. The results were interesting when I got them, but the process beforehand was quite frustrating. Purchase at your own risk.",2018-01-12 00:00:00

23andMe,,Only useful if you have one of the very rare diseases 23andMe screens for. Otherwise Ancestry.com or Genographic is more helpful,Uberdoc,,,32,3.0,"I had high hopes for the results from 23andMe's DNA testing. Would it show me my risk for Alzheimer's disease, or my risk for developing type 2 diabetes? Would it tell me my risk for dying from coronary artery disease, or developing Parkinson's disease (both type 2 diabetes and Parkinson's disease are hot research areas for Google - the wife of founder Sergei Brin is one of the owners of 23andMe). No, unfortunately not. Instead, I learned that I am (thankfully!) not at risk for developing Glycogen Storage Disease Ib, or Bloom Syndrome, or Maple Syrup Urine disease type 1B. I also learned that I am not lactose intolerant (incorrect), and that I am unlikely to flush when I drink alcohol (correct). The testing linked me to 3500 distant 3rd to 5th cousins with whom I share only minimal DNA, which I did not find very useful.
Prior to my purchasing the the $199 Health and Ancestry 23andMe testing kit, I did review the slick and well done 23andMe website and watched several of the videos. I researched the background behind the company, and the prior changes in testing and controversies behind some of the earlier tests run by 23andMe. The kit directions are very straight-forward, and the sample collection is easy. 23andMe states that you should allow up to 6 weeks for the sample results to be posted on-line, but mine and my wife's were up in about three weeks. The on-line reports are very nicely laid out, with very good explanations of the results.
All in all, I feel the usefulness of the 23andMe testing is still evolving. Hopefully as better DNA testing is developed, the test results will become more helpful for those of us that want to predict our chances of developing the more common disease states that kill or cripple us, rather than the oddball rarities that 23andMe currently tests for.",2016-12-30 00:00:00

23andMe,,I found it worth the money.,B. Ahmed,,,53,4.0,"I did the Ancestry DNA test before this one and I wasn't happy with the results. I thought they were too vague and generalized. I know both my parents and I wanted to see how 23andme would come out.
This kit took less than 3 weeks to get results and I was glad I took it. My mother is 100% Bosnian and I tested at 49.5% Southern European, which is true. The AncestryDNA test had me at 27% Eastern European (which is more Slovakia/Russia/Poland) and 17% Italy/Greece (maybe a better designation for this would be the Mediterranean). Anc does not have a designation for Southern European.
AncestryDNA found me at 42% West Asian and I have no Asian blood whatsoever. I am Egyptian on my father's side where 23andme found me to be more precise North Africa 36%/Middle East 5%. The rest was broadly Southern Europe. AncestryDNA has a designation for North Africa but it is more Northwest Africa (Tunisia, Algeria, Morocco) and did not include Egypt.
In this aspect, I am glad that I took this test. It was much more accurate and closer to what I actually am. I know people have migrated and moved across continents over time,but still, this test found me at very little Eastern European whereas AncestryDNA had me at a much higher percentage.
I am glad to have received different reports on what I may look like. Everything was accurate (dark hair, dark eyes), but my skin tone was off (light beige whereas I am much darker olive color) and it said I would have freckles (which I don't).
I know we inherit about 50% from each of the parents, but this test found me to be more European at 60% than AncestryDNA at 50%.23 found me at 10% broadly Southern European which includes the Mediterranean, since both my parents are Mediterranean.

I was surprised to see that my daughter had a significant amount of Eastern European/Jewish ancestry, since her great grandfather was born in a home for unwed, Catholic moms.
If you order this for the ancestry, you must be realistic. Some people are disappointed that the tests sometimes point to regions, instead of specific countries. Countries are political constructs. Do you really think the test can determine if you are Irish or English when people in that region basically share the same DNA? So be realistic in your expectations.",2017-07-10 00:00:00

Other buyers have tried to get their money back or their data, but 23andMe is not releasing the raw data they have on these SNPs that other users had just the month before. They report 23andMe is saying ""too bad, so sad, we don't recommend using raw data anyway"". I shouldn't have procrastinated- I thought, I will wait and do it.

23andMe,,Great Wealth of Knowledge and Interesting Finds,A. Hsiao,,,4,5.0,"I got the 23andMe DNA Test with the Health one and am very glad that I got the health one. I purchased this product on Prime day and shipped it out the next day after I received the package to spit into. It was an easy process to follow. All in all, it took around 5 weeks from sending to be completely processed with the report ready.

Let’s start with the providing the sample stage:
The instructions are in the box and are pretty clear of what you have to do. Make sure to register your sample with the website first or else there may be problems down the road. The part that I found most tricky was to actually provide the spit amount they required. My spit came out with a lot of bubbles which made it hard because they wanted liquid and not bubbles filled to a certain place. After spitting, there was this solution to cap off the tube. I then put it inside a bag and the box with the prepaid label. I would recommend taking a picture of the label since it has the tracking number in case something goes wrong. The tracking number should also be shown on the website but I heard from people that sometimes the one on website is inaccurate. Therefore, better safe than sorry.

The Wait:
Now that I sent it off via the post office, it was time to wait. I was a little worried about them receiving my package because they didn't log my package until approximately 2 weeks after tracking said the package was received. It then moved to the different stages of extraction pretty quickly. I got my results in about 5 weeks total from shipping it out.

The Results:
It actually shocked me quite a bit in how it can narrow my ethnicity down to a specific region and country. That's very awesome. When I got this kit, I was more excited for the health part though. It tells you what you are potentially a carrier for, what your genetic health risk is. When clicking into each one, it provides a description of what gene/strand is causing an increased risk which in my opinion is very interesting. It can also tell you things about your traits such as whether or not you are likely to have dimples. Mine were mostly correct except for one or two. For 100 dollars that I paid on prime day, I think this is well worth it!",2018-11-08 00:00:00

I got my sister and my best friend on 23 and Me recently, hoping to do this very thing. Unfortunately all either of us see for me is ""not available"". I can see all their exciting information just fine, but if I want to see mine I have to go download the PDF and sift through it.

If they are going to keep older customers on a lesser platform every time they do updates then maybe we should be told about it. I would think with a service like this they would keep everyone on the same page, or at least as close as they could. They still have my health data, and my DNA sample. There really is very little reason they shouldn't update customers to the same levels.

Color me disappointed. I have told so many people about this over the years that wound up buying the kits but I didn't realize they were doing this to older customers until I saw what my sister and best friend can see on their's. Mine is void of all the data I once saw. It is a shame. If I put my kids on it, which they want me to, I will be unable to compare anything with them either. So I guess my choices are to forget about it or start all over again- which is ridiculous.",2018-04-18 00:00:00

When you 1st get your results back you may be disappointed in the info that is given - it's extremely basic and things you already know, like whether you can smell asparagus in your pee (who cares about that?! odds are you already know that and don't need a test to tell you that). Certain gene mutations will pop up on 23andMe, I only had 1. You need to download the raw data and then upload it to a site that analyzes it for you, like Promethease, which is ten bucks. This site will show you all of your genetic mutations, rate them good, neutral, or bad. Then you can filter out to see what is of real concern. The drug interactions were very surprising to me - for instance, I shouldn't have certain blood thinners if I ever have a heart issue. That's good info to have! However, you can get the SAME raw data by just getting the ancestry kit. So save yourself 1/2 the cost and get the ancestry version.

23andMe,,Useful For Learning,Sherla Holmes,,,6,5.0,"Got this during Prime Day so paid $100 plus sales tax for the health + ancestry report. Was afraid at first because I wasn't sure if it was legit, being on Amazon and being sold by a 3rd party. But turns out it is legit - same as ordering directly from 23andMe, no difference - except if you order directly from 23andMe you don't pay sales tax (but pay shipping), while on Amazon you pay sales tax (but get free Prime delivery). Awesome deal for $100 really!

Test kit arrived in 2 days. Followed instructions, which was really easy since it's all clearly written and illustrated. Sent it back.

I registered my details online and completed some of the surveys/interviews. I had to answer many questions about illnesses that I never even knew existed! There was also these questions about how much I exercised and how much veggies I ate. After doing the surveys, it made me realize that my health & fitness isn't as good as I'd like - and this realization actually made me implement immediate changes in my lifestyle. And I haven't even got my DNA results yet!

Anyway, it's my first time doing DNA testing, so I learned quite a bit about how it works which makes it an interesting experience. 23andMe also makes the learning rather friendly for the layperson to understand. They might have done too good a job because with my newfound knowledge I spotted an amusing error on their website! It's for the tutorial about how we inherit one chromosome from our mother and one from our father. In the illustration, they showed father as XX instead of XY, so it appeared like two lesbians gave birth to me! Looks like a very tired graphic artist had to hurry this off and no one saw the mistake. ;)

Anyway, it's been 3 weeks since I sent back my results. There's a progress bar showing that my test results are halfway through the analysis process. Will update again when it's completed. I'm especially curious because there's not much in the database about my known ethnicity.",2017-08-11 00:00:00
23andMe,,These tests have recently changed! Beware before you spend your money,Kindle Customer,,,3,1.0,"When I ordered this test it was ONLY to have certain Gene's tested for (for my 6 month old son, for health and genetic reasons). But I read after ordering it that its hard to get enough saliva from a 6 month old. So I left it sitting in the box it was delivered in, on my table for the past 2 months untouched. I just read an article recently that 23andme was just bought by another company and no longer tests for those Genes any longer. So this is completely useless to me and still in the original box and plastic. I am technically out of my refund window but really REALLY hoping someone will contact me regarding this and give me an exception since this was never even opened. My doctor charges alot to do this gene testing and I NEED to be refunded in order to be able to afford this. I am incredibly bummed that the company changed what's included in this testing after I purchased it. :(",2018-09-26 00:00:00
23andMe,,You may be an ancestor by the time you get your results,cjr,,,1,3.0,"Three stars, as I am very neutral on this products - not loving or hating it.

I liked that it arrived quickly and the instructions were very easy to follow. Swab your check a few minutes, put swab in tube, mail off, make sure you've created your account online and you're finished. The test is pretty forgiving as well, as my wife made a few mistakes in the process but results came back just fine.

My biggest complaint is our neighbors ordered one of the many other kits out there AFTER we were talking about it one night and had already ordered ours. They not only mailed theirs in after us, but had their results back a few weeks earlier. Our results took about 2 months to get back to us - by then much of the excitement and anticipation was gone, though it was still neat to see what they were.

These worked fine but for the price, I would recommend trying one of the many others out there. You'll get the same information, just a lot sooner. If they're on a great sale, or you're not really not an impatient person in the slightest, these will likely work fine for you.",2018-12-18 00:00:00

DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY on a health kit!! It doesn't give much information. For the 50 something health assessments, it told me I'm 3% more likely to weigh more than the average person. I already knew that- I'm round. It told me I'm 4% more likely to prefer Savory flavors over sweet.
It said if I eat a diet in saturated fats, I'll weigh more. Duh!
The BASIC $99 kit is AWESOME. I gained a significant amount of information from that, including confirmation of questionable ancestry findings that I just wasn't sure were accurate- and now its confirmed through DNA that I DO have Scandinavian roots. Who knew? VERY exciting. Now I have to figure out what some of the DNA coding means and it was a hoot to look up relatives around the globe that I'm related to. Almost 2000 folks who have also done the 23andme test- even relatives in Australia!

You spit in the collection thing and drop it in the mall. In about 4 - 6 weeks for find out you a ton about your genetic makeup.

Pros:
1. Tells you fun facts like you may die of some horrible disease
2. Let's you know what your skin color probably is
3. Did you pass down horrible conditions to your kids? The test has you covered.
4. Guys, worried about going bald, it lets you know.

The test isn't 100% accurate, it's based on comparisons of people with similar traits. For me it got a few things wrong like it said I may have freckles and I don't but your results are updated as more information comes in and as the testing improves.

Cons:
1. If you worry about stuff like horrible life ending diseases, genetic conditions, and general sadness maybe skip the heath section and just spring for the ansestry portion.
2. It's not 100% accurate which can be a blessing. Many environmental factors affect your heath. Like the test can't predict you being killed in a pickle eating contest, so worrying about Parkinson's would have been a waste of time.

23andMe,,Good system if it works properly. Unfortunately my son had two successive failures to extract DNA with 23andme,pbk63,,,1,4.0,My son and daughter and I have used both Ancestry DNA and 23and me Ancestry and Health. Both are good and give interesting results. RawDNA from both can be used with alternative sites for added information such as Livewello or Premethease. I purchased Ancestry from Amazon but my son bought the 23and me for Christmas for us through Amazon. One caution is that my son used both Ancestry and 23andme and had no issues with Ancestry which came back very quickly. Same with my daughter and I. We did the 23andme with no problem but my son had two successive failures with 23andme and they just refunded him his money rather than figuring out their problem. Suspect it may be a kit or lab problem with them but unclear at this point. But if you try this and get it rejected saying they could not extract the DNA you may want to try something like Ancestry or MyHeritage.

- You can take your data and upload it to Promethease for more analysis
- It feels good to take part in the large scale studies and help out science

CONS:
- Accuracy is questionable, even for the ancestry part
- The large scale research studies rely on subjective surveys...it is always questionable whether people answer these accurately
- I don't think I really learned anything terribly interesting or new from this test
- Interpretation is therefore best left up to the professionals, in my opinion",2018-08-05 00:00:00
23andMe,,The best DNA service I have found - and having the health information makes this the far superior choice,LovingLife,,,0,5.0,"I purchased my DNA and Health kit from 23andMe about 6 months ago. I am so so happy I chose this company above all of the others. I did some research ahead of time on what each company offered, and I liked the fact that 23andMe provides health background information, and that they are conducting research on a regular basis (which you can voluntarily participate in) to benefit our collective knowledge about health and hereditary factors that affect health. I also like the fact that you pay a one-time fee, and then you have access to the website, their forums for discussions, customer service staff, and others who have joined, on an on-going basis. As an adoptee, it has been fantastic to find biological relatives who have been able to share stories and history of my biological family with me. I knew so little when I started, and I have an amazing family tree built now that spans centuries. I have relatives that have now joined 23andMe also, and the collective information is really helpful to families looking at health and patterns over generations. I recommend this service to people all the time, and I have gifted many people with kits. Their customer service staff is timely to respond, really helpful and responsive.

I like that it had the health section which was quite informative and a little relieving to see that I didn’t have some genetic issues that I thought I might.

However, recently we got the tests done for our kids and the current report is of no use for me and does not provide any information that i can act on. I contacted the customer service several times and they mentioned that after the latest law suite from US Government, they stopped giving the Rick profiles.

23andMe,,What a great deal. I wish I bought 2 more,Zam,,,0,5.0,"I purchased my 3rd kit for $99 on Prime Day! What a great deal. I wish I bought 2 more! I had already purchased a kit for my husband and one for my son (in the past 6 months) at the full price of $199, obviously we all liked it or I wouldn't be buying another. The Ancestry part was spot on. Also, the 23 and me database was able to correctly identify two family cousins (we didn't even know they had done the testing). It also offered a list of probable second and third cousins who we are attempting to contact. I was impressed at the size of the 23 and me database. We are also very interested in the Health profile. This service offers a tremendous amount of raw data, but offers little in depth interpretation. In order to gain better insight to our health profile, we first used geneticgenie.com (for free analysis) and then also paid the $5 to Prometheus.com. Very interesting results. In fact, I feel the Health Profile was more useful than the ancestry. The ancestry was fun, but the health profile identifies gene mutation information which was very helpful for prescribing medications.

Providing the sample is very easy. You provide your saliva by spitting into a tube, then when you close the tube a preservative is added. The sample is then capped, bagged and returned to 23andme in the provided and readdressed, postage paid box. The hardest part is the waiting on your results! Took about 5 weeks in the past. I suspect it might take a week or so longer this time just because of the special price of the Prime Day deal. I really hope Amazon offers this deal again because we would like to purchase two more kits!",2017-07-25 00:00:00
23andMe,,For the curious,Grandmaof4,,,0,4.0,"My husband & I both did this. Spit is collected in a test tube, a stabilizer is added & the whole thing is sent to the lab. Very professional looking. Results came back 6-8 weeks later. We understand it isn't an exact science & we receive frequent requests to fill out information to help their research. It also means we have access to ongoing reports. I don't know what the accuracy rate is but I'm 1/2 Swedish--my grandmother came from Sweden & all previous generations lived there. My report said I had a small portion of Swedish blood from several generations back. I think health information comes from the surveys not from the blood analysis. As more people answer surveys, it'll give a clearer picture concerning various genetic dispositions that may or may not apply to your blood type. I don't like that the reports aren't mailed to us, it's on-line & it is confusing as it isn't a continuous document. We bought this on a special 2 for 1 sale & at $99 each, it was still pricey for what you get.

23andMe,,More for your money with 23andMe,John,,,32,5.0,"For the money, it is hard to beat 23andMe. The accuracy and results you receive from 23andMe are much better. Contrary to what I've read on a couple of websites, you DO receive your mt-DNA, and if you are a male, your y-DNA test results as well. In 23andMe you also receive you autosomal test results, aka ""family finder"" DNA results, all in one bundle at one time cost. Yes, it is true, 23andMe has a large data base and many people do not want to share their results, but is that a bad thing? You can share with whom you want, or not at all, that is your choice. 23andMe also tests for 39 medical carrier variants. With Family Tree DNA testing you can dwell deeper and more precise than the other tests, however, each test will costs you more. I, my mother, and my wife have had our DNA tested by 23andMe, Family Tree, and National Geographic Genome Project. They each have their strong points, but for most people, and for the money, 23andMe is the best choice.",2016-09-07 00:00:00
23andMe,,The Prices is Too High But Thorough Report,C. Ward,,,0,4.0,"Very thorough report. My only complaints are that the ancestry results use too many broad categories and Great Britain and Ireland are combined. I would like to know percentage of Irish ancestry compared to British and Scottish. Also, nobody wants a broad range of multiple areas of Europe. We want specific data. But it is clear to me that I come from Great Britain, France and Germany mainly. I really like how you can select the confidence interval for your ancestry results. The default is 50%, but you can select up to 90%. At 90% confidence interval I am only 7% from Great Britain/Ireland for certain, but I have high percentages in the broad categories that include those areas as well. As you reduce your confidence interval, the numbers are reallocated from the broad categories and change. I also like the 23 chromosome map where you can see specifically where each region is located in your chromosomes. And I like that it matches you with your relatives all over the world.

Kuehn,,,0,5.0,"Based on some of the reviews, it probably would help to have some level of knowledge about genetics so you would know more about the limitations of the reporting. And the granularity of the reporting is going to be based on the size of the database. Until there is a substantial increase of, say, Asians subscribing, the results are likely to be limited. Finding relatives is going to be limited by the number of DNA relatives who have subscribed to the service. And this is true for any of the DNA test sites. For me, I found it interesting, enlightening, and in some cases the results have been humorous.

23andMe,,DNA for me!,WritingIrish,,,1,5.0,"Can't wait for my results. I think they should be more transparent and up front that it takes about 2 months to get your results. Also, that the ""health"" part of the DNA test is really just them asking you a buttload of questions online, and if you don't answer it, you don't get the ""dna health"" part. They also send you kind of a nasty reminder that ""you agreed"" to this, except you didn't know you had to answer dozens of questions.

However, if the lab can not extract the DNA you will not be refunded for the $30.00 for the test. Even if you are 92 years old.
Once you open the package inside the direction packet, it states DNA is for people of children barring years or something to that order.
Well, at that point your in for a penny in for a pound. Can;t return a open lab test. I think they should put that right up front.

23andMe,,"Easy to Submit for Test. Some Results Were Important, Other Results Didn't Matter To Me.",Blossoms,,,48,3.0," UPDATE (9-30-2016) I received my results online, and here are my thoughts:

I was very interested in the following results:
1. Haplogroups. It tells me where a small portion of my ancestors originated thousands of years ago, and what ancestor groups I am assigned to based on certain genetic variants.
2. Ancestry Composition: This breaks down what percentage of each ancestry I am composed of.
3. Carrier Status: Tell me what genes I am a carrier for, and whether or not this may affect me. This is great information so I can also test my children in the future to see if they have carried anything I would have. This does not tell you whether you are a carrier from the mother of the father. The mother and the father both have to do the 23andMe test in order for you to find out. Examples of such variants that were included in the report:
-Beta Thalassemia and Related Hemoglobinopathies
-Cystic Fibrosis
-Glycogen Storage Disease Type la
-MCAD Deficiency

Information that I already knew, but was still included in the report:
1. My hair color
2. Whether or not I was Lactose Intolerant
3. How deep is my sleep
4. My eye color
5. Whether or not I have freckles
6. Finger Length Ratio
7. Whether or not I have a unibrow
8. “You are not likely to sneeze when suddenly exposed to bright sunlight”…Yes, I already knew that!
9. Whether or not I can taste certain bitter compounds. I have a pretty good sense of taste, and can taste a lot of foods pretty well, including bitter or sweet. So this was no surprise to me either.

There are other results which I thought were not correct, but were included in the report.
1. My Skin color is not light, and the report says I have light/fair skin, and excluded olive from my results, even though olive skin can be part of the results. I do have olive skin (take a look at my other video reviews and you will see my skin color)
2. I have a longer second toe than my big toe. But the report tells the opposite. I can just look at my feet to tell that my second toe is longer.
3. “You are not likely to have cheek dimples” statement is incorrect. I have cheek dimples when I smile, and I am actually pretty known to my friends and family for having dimples. My husband loves them!

This result made me laugh out loud:
“You are likely to be able to smell the asparagus metabolite in your pee”. My question is, why asparagus in particular? How about apples, broccoli, fish, parsley, or any other foods that I normally enjoy? I don’t eat asparagus that much anyways to justify having these specific results in the report. And I don’t think that this information was important for me anyhow.

The 23andMe reports can be plugged into other websites and genetic tests for free or at cost to detect other tests and results. I think that the price is a little too much for the information that was given to me, especially because I already knew some of these results anyways. I would love to be able to pick and choose what information can be included on my test, which can affect the price and can reduce it significantly, especially had I excluded a lot of the information on there that are less important to me.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ORIGINAL REVIEW:
The 23andMe kit is intended for DNA testing. The results of this test can show different genetic factors such as gene mutations, certain diseases, etc. It includes 65+ personalized results of your genetics. The nice thing about 23andMe test kit is that I was able to do this from the comfort of my own home. I did not need to go see a doctor, nor did I need to go visit the lab and get poked with needles. It makes it easy and convenient, especially because I was able to send in my samples via mail, without having to drop them off myself at a lab. Another convenient feature is that I will receive my results via email. This not only ensures privacy (mailed confidential information can be risky sometimes), but it also makes it faster for me to receive the results and not waiting the extra time for mailed documents.

This is the first part of my review. Since the results will take 6-8 weeks, I will update my review in more detail to include what type of information the results will discuss.

When the 23andMe kit arrived in the mail, I was very anxious to try this. However, there are some steps that have to be followed first before sending in the sample.

1. Must first register your information using the website that is included inside the kit.
2. When registering, you will provide your name, date of birth, as well as an email address.
3. Confirm your email address using the confirmation link provided
4. There is a barcode number inside the kit. The barcode is located on the saliva sample collection tube. This number must be entered online.
5. Agree to the 23andMe privacy policy and consent forms
6. Confirm your information, and you are ready to send in your saliva sample
7. You can also fill out a profile online, which can be shared with anyone you would like
8. There will be a registration confirmation email to follow, which lists the barcode number you provided, as well as your name.
9. You can also enter a different name other than yourself if you are not the one providing the saliva sample.

I have taken a measurement of the collection tube, which is about 6” long. However, the amount of saliva you would need to provide is much smaller than the length of the tube itself. It only took me about 3 minutes total to reach the ""fill line"".
I collected my saliva samples and here is my experience:

1. I must not eat or drink anything for 30 minutes prior to collection. I drank a glass of water about 45 minutes before collection time, and this helped with making sure that there was enough liquid in my system in order to provide a saliva sample (highly recommend this step)
2. I started spitting into the tube, and I noticed there were bubbles inside. A trick that I used, which I did not see listed on the instruction manual, is to tap the tube gently to remove any bubbles. Tapping the tube gently on a solid surface made the collection go faster and smoother.
3. The wide funnel is such a great idea! This is a great feature to have, and I wish more companies can start adding funnels to their collection tubes. This made sure that all of the saliva goes into the tube, and not on the floor or on my clothes.
4. The saliva must reach the fill line shown on the tube. Again, drinking water really helps with this.
5. After I the fill line has been reached, I closed the funnel lid until I heard a loud click. The clicking sound will release the liquid that is inside the lid. This is a stabilizing liquid.
6. After the stabilizing liquid mixed with the saliva, I unscrewed the funnel from the tube and discarded it. There is a small blue cap (see photos) that can be used to close the tube. Then I gently shook the capped tube for about 5 seconds.
7. There is a plastic bag that is included with the 23andMe kit. I put the collection tube inside, and sealed the bag. There is a white colored absorbent pad that is inside the bag. This pad must stay inside, and not to be removed.
8. I placed the sealed bag inside the box. The box also comes with a pre-sealed adhesive strip to close it.
9. Shipping for the box has already been prepaid. The bottom of the box includes a paid-for shipping label through FedEx Express. It is a Priority Overnight shipping label. However, please be aware on which day to send this sample. The shipping label indicated to return the box Monday through Friday.

Included is a short video which shows the contents of the 23andMe kit. I hope that this review was helpful for you! I will update my review as soon as I get the results.

P.S. The 23andMe Kit was provided at little or no cost to thoroughly test and give my opinion, and I never let that influence how I rate or review a product. Also, I make no promise of a good rating while testing a product. I have found that writing reviews has become an enjoyable hobby of mine. I love it when I know that I have made people's day when writing a helpful review (if not, why). Please let me know if you have any questions or comments about the 23andMe Kit, and I promise to answer them as quickly as possible (usually within 24 hours) based on my experience with the product.",2016-08-31 00:00:00

A slight chance of a visual problem.

What I found interesting was that 4% of my DNA is Neanderthal DNA. I didn't realize I was a unibrow. LOL.

The best part was that I found a first cousin who the family had lost track of 35 years ago after a nasty fall out between he and his parents. He was living one block from me. It's been good to reconnect with someone that I played with as a child 50 years ago.",2018-03-22 00:00:00

I chose to let them do what they want with my sample, and to use it for their purposes since it appears that it may end up being helpful to others.

23andMe,,"Easy-to-use testing kit offers basic, helpful reports and provides gateway to more information",Reviewer Dr. Beth,,,18,4.0,"NOTE: I received a free sample of the 23andMe Kit to try for review purposes. I am an amateur, unpaid reviewer and received absolutely NO compensation beyond this free product sample.

I have done a little research into genealogy with the assistance of my father-in-law, who is very active in this area. I am also very health-conscious. Both of these things contributed to me being curious about having genetic testing done, so I was excited to have the opportunity to use 23andMe.

The kit shipped to me quickly. The instructions for how to provide your sample (you are basically spitting your salvia into a plastic test tube) are very clear. The kit is return postage paid and couldn't be easier to use. You must create an account online with 23andMe before you return your kit so that your sample can be tracked and accounted for, but this was an easy process as well. I was told that the entire process would take 6-8 weeks, but it was MUCH faster than that! A little over a week after I sent my sample in, I received an email saying that it had been received, and just a few days after that, my reports were ready.

You have the option to choose whether you want the full reports or not. I choose to receive all of them: there are 39 carrier status, 3 ancestry reports, 7 wellness reports, and 19 trait reports. I will provide further information on each of these categories below.

The carrier status reports show whether yo may have a variant for particular kinds of diseases. These are definitely more rare genetic disorders that you would probably already know about if you had one of the--e.g., cystic fibrosis. The test does NOT test for any cancer risk, including breast cancer.

I found the wellness reports interesting. One thing it told me was that I was likely lactose intolerant--this is something I suspected about myself, but I have never been diagnosed. (I believe I have a mild case.) There is also information on how you react to low-fat diets as well as details about sleep, including whether you are likely to be a deep sleeper and have more movement in your sleep.

The ancestry reports were a bit disappointing. I came out 100% European, which is not really a surprise sine my mother's family is Italian and my father's familian is from Northern Europe. But the breakdowns given were more vague, with 6.8% of my ancestry somewhat unclassified as ""Broadly European.""

The summary offered by 23andMe explains that the traits reports provides information about ""how your DNA influences your physical appearance, preferences, and physical responses."" The information predicted here is interesting, but again, it is likely to mostly be things that you already know. For example, my report said that I have a 90% chance of darker eyes and 67% chance of dark brown hair--which is what I have. It also predicted that I have a 95% chance of NOT having a unibrow (thank goodness), although it was a little off in suggesting that there's a 70% chance that I don't have a widow's peak (I do have one).

These are just the basics from my 6-page summary report; 23andMe offers tons of additional research and data that you can pour over if you choose. Even better, the site allows you access to your raw data from your testing. You can download this information and share it with several other genetic testing sites (both free and paid) to get much, much more information. I have done this, I would say the ability to do this definitely makes the initial testing costs well worth the price. I also shared my data with my father-in-law, who informed me that what I received was MUCH more detailed and helpful than what he obtained from the site where he had his DNA testing performed (Ancestry).

In the end, I definitely would recommend 23andMe to anyone who is considering genetic testing.",2016-09-23 00:00:00

23andMe,,Your odds of getting results may as well be roulette.,dark54555,,,4,1.0,"I don't even know how to begin to describe how disappointing 23andMe customer service is.

I bought 2 kits. I mailed in 2 kits on the same day. They tracked with each other day for day through the process until Analysis (same quality check, same extraction, entered Analysis the same). One kit had results August 11, well below the 6-8 weeks they represent. The other kit? Well, we're almost to 9 weeks without seeing results. And Customer Service can't seem to tell me anything other than it's been escalated. No estimated time frame for resolution. No offers of anything to attempt to make amends for the delay. Nothing but a very hollow apology.

More importantly, they offer two means of customer service: by e-mail and by phone. Do not ever waste your time on e-mailing them. All you will get is a form letter which indicates no one read your inquiry in the first place. Call them, and even then, you'll have to get to a higher level than the front line to get any results. Or at least I assume that you can get results; that remains to be seen on my end. At least the 2nd tier people will make a ticket with a number to make you feel like something might eventually happen.

The reports are cool, if you get them.
The data is interesting, if you get it.
There are some other nifty programs you can run the raw data through for more information, if you ever get your raw data.

But at the end of the day, this seems like results roulette: you either get it super fast or potentially not at all. And for something that costs this much, a chance at getting what you paid for doesn't seem like a good deal.",2017-09-20 00:00:00

23andMe,,Provided accurate and fascinating results,Nicholas A. Sparr,,,0,5.0,"I'd previously received the Ancestry.com package as a gift, so I primarily decided to purchase the 23andMe kit for information about genetic markers.

As far as information about ancestry, it seems to me that Ancestry.com provided more accurate results or at least more specific results (Ancestry was more likely to name particular countries or groups of people from which my ancestors belonged, whereas 23andme was more likely to name an entire continent as my ancestral origin). The results between Ancestry.com and 23andMe were roughly similar, and I did like that 23andMe provides information about Neanderthal variants in your DNA.

23andMe's information regarding propensity for disease and other phenotypes was fascinating and seemed to be highly accurate for me. I also appreciate the ability to download the raw data for the purpose of seeking out more information.

I also noticed on one of the particular ethnicity which I was certain was higher and later confirmed that belief by a different DNA test was just a fraction of my ethnicity on 23andme. I then noticed I started to gain more and more ancestors on this particular ethnicity which made it obvious that they had miscalculated or had not calculated it at all. To the extent they started removing people from my graph to make their error less obvious. They then changed the entire format of their site which made it a nightmare to navigate.

23andMe,,Not very accurate - regret purchase,Fixer,,,3,1.0,"We actually know a fair bit of our ancestry. Thought maybe we could fine tune it. But this is so far off. For instance - we don't know of any southern European, yet this shows 22% of that. It got the Northwestern European right. Completely missed the known Native American of 6% (said <.1%). We know of 12% pure Turkish (Great Grandmother), yet it said .4% of ""Broadly Middle Eastern"". 12% Blond hair Blue-eyed Great Grandfather from Crimea but don't see that anywhere (sure it's possible he is from Scandinavia (though that says only .4%) or Germany but what are the chances?
I think if someone is white/European and they don't know specifics already, anything 23andMe puts on their report will be believable. But if you know things that don't show up...this raises the alarm bells and indicates deception or incompetence. The complete lack of positives in our case on two very-much known ancestry branches pretty much nullifies the accuracy of the test.
I would like to see someone send in two samples from the same person, or two brothers, and see if they end up different.
As far as the the trait reports - I think a dice roll would have been more accurate.
The so-called ""medical"" information - completely useless.

23andMe,,fustrating experience,Liz,,,10,1.0,"My husband and I purchased two of these kits. We mailed them in on the same day. Now, over two months later, he's had his results for weeks and I'm still waiting. We had wanted to do this together and despite both kids being purchased together there is no option to hold up results until both are back. It's like sitting in a restaurant and the server brings out your dining companions food first and you just sit there while saying 'no, go ahead, eat it while it's hot' all the while being annoyed at the restaurant for not waiting until both meals were done prior to serving.

The problem was that my sample came back as 'insufficient dna'. Ok, not their fault. I put in the information to get the replacement kit within hours of receiving the email. It took over a week for it to arrive, way longer than the original kit took. I used it and mailed it back within the day. It took a week and a half for it to be received by them. No express shipping option even if I was willing to pay for it. It's now been two weeks since they received that kit back and over two months since the original kit was started. Still no results. I contacted them and was curtly told (in the form of a form letter) word to the effect of 'sorry to hear that but too bad, keep waiting and you'll eventually get results. It turns out redo kits are sent to the back of the line to wait all over again. Now with Father's Day gifts in the mix the wait is significantly longer than my first wait. They have my money, why should they make the effort to keep things moving quickly now?

I just can't recommend 23 and me. Once they get your money they could care less about anything else with the exception of endless emails trying to get you to fill out surveys with zero compensation so they can sell data.",2017-06-23 00:00:00

So we can send a note, but will never ever know who he is, he may not even be set to receive sharing notices, or messages of any kind and won't tell us that, nor will they tell him to turn on messaging. So if you want to know if you have the standard BRAC1 or 2 genes or carry the alzheimers gene, then by all means waste your money. If you are trying to find family, do not bother.

So when this test went on sale at Amazon, I jumped at it. The info on this kit states 'maternal and paternal', but the results only give you the maternal details. It says that the DNA is determined by the mother, and if you want to know about your father, to have HIM send in a kit (which I can't -- since he's dead). I have no living male family members.

I also question the detailed info on the questionnaire that you must complete before testing. How much of the results are estimated by 23andme based your given information? I mean, geez--if I knew all the answers to their questions about my father, then I wouldn't be paying them to tell me!

It was interesting to see the genetic inclination factors for certain medical conditions (assuming that they're accurate). And the results did come in the stated time period. But other than that, I'm very disappointed.

UPDATE: I'm told that I'm mistaken, and that the results reflect a combination DNA. I am still not totally satisfied, because I was under the impression that the results would be more specific regarding the paternal side.

23andMe,,Only as an expensive starting point,oldmusiclover,,,7,2.0,"I was super excited to gain insights into my ancestry and concerned about health issues that might be hereditary. What I got were results matching my survey answers.

If you're female, ancestry is worthless unless you don't know where a parent is from. If you do, you'll just get a general location, no specifics. For example, if you're European, it can narrow it down a sector but if you're of British ancestry it might pick up Viking or Norman genes since they invaded the UK way back, but it won't tell you that you have to read up on it from history.

The health part was kinda cool but mostly just random meaningless stuff like if you can smell something in pee or sneezing in the sun. Everything seems like hearsay bc nothing is certain. For example you are sensitive to caffeine it might say that you are likely to drink more caffeine than most others. Huh? Not very accurate.

This is a VERY starter type test for if you know nothing or have the money to throw at it for fun. In that case it's great. Maybe for guys it's better with that extra chromosome.

As an answer to someone's question, yes it specifies the caffeine gene.",2017-07-10 00:00:00

I did use the raw data and purchased another health report from another site and learned a lot of interesting things (whether or not they’re accurate is up for debate). I think 23andme does a great job getting the results.

If I did it again, I’d still use 23andme and put the raw data into another program again. It might be possible to do this without the health one (just the ancestry), but that’s something to look into if you’re interested and want to save $100.",2019-01-23 00:00:00

23andMe,,Might as well flip a coin,Nicole McCleary,,,0,1.0,"The older I have gotten, the more interested I have become in learning about my ancestry. Over the years, my parents have told me where they think our ancestors are from, so I thought it would be fun to use one of these DNA test kits to confirm. If you're like me and looking for any sort of specific breakdown or confirmation of your ancestry, then this kit is likely not for you. If I could have given zero stars, I would have.

One positive is that I received my ancestry composition report in under two weeks. Since I tested right after Christmas, I expected to wait the full 6-8 weeks they state it could take to receive results because I assumed lots of people received these kits as gifts and would be eager to test, like me. I was pleasantly surprised that the results came back quickly.

At first glance, the report was exciting. It appeared to show my ancestry composition in a tidy and easy to read percentage list. But the more I reviewed my report, the more confused I became and the more questions I had. For example, the report as they sent it to me said I am a certain percentage ""French and German."" Yes, they lump the two into one category. It does not break it down more specifically to say I am actually this certain percentage French and this certain percentage German. I mean, I understand that France and Germany share a border in some places, but I think it is a mistake and makes it very unclear to the user how much French and how much German ancestry they really have.

I was also disappointed to see that a significant portion of my DNA is labeled in what 23andme calls Broadly Assigned Ancestry Groups. The explanation they give in their Frequently Asked Questions section is that if your DNA matches reference DNA from many different European countries, but none outside of Europe, for example, then they label your DNA Broadly European. In other words, either their algorithm or their reference database is unable to differentiate between the many, many countries in Europe, so they clump it all together and simply call you Broadly European. Such a population label is extremely underwhelming for someone looking to learn more about from where their ancestors hailed.

I could go on and on about my disappointments, but I'll get to my final point. As I continued to review my ancestry composition report, I noticed that near the bottom of the page in small font, there is a link giving users the ability to change the confidence level of the report. I will spare you the boring details, but if you don't know what confidence level is, look it up. It is extremely important. The confidence level of the ""detailed"" report they send you is set at a 50% confidence level. 50%!!! They themselves label this level of confidence ""speculative."" At 50% confidence, you yourself could pick any population group in the world and flip a coin to determine if your ancestors were from that area and you would be just as accurate as their report! Literally. That is not an exaggeration and it is not a lie. Look it up, educate yourselves. The worst part is that when I changed the confidence level to 90% (without going into detail, this means they are way more certain of the results than at 50%), my report changed DRAMATICALLY. Population categories where I was previously told I derived nearly 40% of my DNA dropped down to 2%. And the majority of my ancestry composition, over 90% to be precise, was lumped into the Broadly European category. Do you have any idea how many countries exist in Europe? Not to be insensitive, but I could have saved money and looked in the mirror to determine that I am of broadly European descent.

I simply cannot believe that more people are not taking issue with the confidence level. If you are looking at your report as they sent it to you (at 50% confidence level) and telling people about your ancestry composition based off of that, then you are simply speculating. Nothing more. I think it's actually very misleading that this company can even advertise that they can tell you a lot about your ancestry composition. In reality, they can tell you very few specifics.",2019-01-12 00:00:00

Their traits results were uncanny and spot on. Ancestry results were a good 35% inaccurate. 23&me said I preferred salty over sweet, and I’m a night owl which is 100% accurate.....ancestry said I liked sweets and likely get up at 7am. I don’t get out of bed before 10am since I stay up most nights until 2 am . The real kicker was 23&me found I have the genetic anomaly called Familiar Mediterranean Fever and should consult a physician if planning to have children. My Mom lost 2 kids back in the early 50’s from SIDS before they were 2 months of age.... maybe it was because of this genetic anomaly.......... but Ancestry DNA results didn’t mention this defect at all.
I didn’t know I shared maternal DNA with King Richard III of England. Again, Ancestry FAILED to mention this.....or that I had ant English heritage AT ALL.

23andMe,,"Crazy List Of Carrier Status, Worthless Plus Lack Of Paternial Information",Brenda ,,,0,2.0,"Took a while to get the results, I was very disappointed overall. I found out my heritage, but that was it. The carrier status list was bogus. Things I have never heard of before, lack of information on diseases that have been here for decades i.e. diabetes Type 1 & 2, SIDS, Specific Cancers, Multiple Births, and one I am not sure of that just showed up in my granddaughter has tuberous sclerosis complex and we have no idea who the carrier is. That one may be a new study I don't know, but the others have been around for decades and that is only a few that I would like to know. Then we to the ancestry and all I really know is where I originated at. My Maternal Haplogroup report I guess was complete. I really don't have any way of knowing. My Paternal had basic that everyone gets and nothing else. Said I had to get my Father or his relations to do tests to get any results. That is ridiculous and impossible since they are all deceased. All, but my Mother is gone and even she could not do it because she has dementia/Alzheimers and they can't tell where I stand with this. I know nothing about my ancestors and only have my Mom left. I wish I would have been told that they were only able to test against (provided a list of their carrier traits tested for) and that you needed family available to really do your ancestry. For me, it was a total waste of money. I have no information to pass on and no way to pursue anything. I am dead in the water. I feel not revealing this kind of information is unfair. Now if my husband wants to pursue his ancestors he can. He has both Maternal and Paternal information. Now the carrier part is the same on him. Of course we both we going to be negative on them all I had hoped for more because I did my research and this was by far the best reviewed. Not in my case. Sadly disappointed. Even with their reply to me. In my opinion, you take a risk with this. Could be good. Could be worthless. I would suggest you have at least two generations still living to do this. All this is just MOP. It is a reference to my experience for your review. Good Luck",2018-12-27 00:00:00

Original review:
The product is underwhelming and 23andme implies that you need to answer dozens upon dozens of nit-picky, invasive questions about your medical history and known ethnic history in order for your results to be interpretable. I thought the point was that they're supposed to be telling us information, not the other way around?

23andMe,,Fast test results! The Health information needs more info!,Hillary and Jared,,,0,4.0,"This DNA Health and Ancestry kit was easy to use and the results came back within a week and a half. I am happy with the Ancestry result, but I think I was expecting more from the health results. I don’t feel like it covers enough. I have autoimmune diseases in my family history, and none of them were tested for except Celiac, which I already know that I have. I’m slightly bummed out, but it was interesting nonetheless. Since I purchased this test during the Black Friday sale, I feel like it was worth the price.",2018-12-07 00:00:00
TellmeGen,,Requires ID document uploads for minors,E. Osborne,,,56,3.0,"I can't comment on the actual test results because I didn't get that far. I ordered this for my son, to compare to my results from 23andme and my parents' results from Ancestry, but I ended up returning the kit because of the account set up requirements. TellmeGen is based in Spain and requires a drivers license or passport number for adults; to set up an account for a minor, it requires an upload of a ""child ID card to verify paternity"" and a ""parent ID card to verify paternity."" I'm not entirely sure what those are and my emails to the company to inquire didn't actually answer that question (birth certificate for the child? Drivers license for the parent? Passport?). I've had my identity stolen, so I inquired about security and the potential for identity theft as well, and the company did respond to that. Here is their reply:

****
We perfectly understand your concern.

It is necessary to provide this documentation by law in Europe and the USA.

With respect to security, we have 3 security barriers.

1) The platform with the data are in the Microsoft cloud services. We have the security that Microsoft itself provides

2) An external company encrypts and monitors all connections to the platform. This company works for large logistics, telecommunications, etc. It works around the world.

3) Within the platform itself, in tellmeGen we have dissociated the genetic and personal data and encrypted this data. So if one part is obtained, the other can't be obtained.

*****
Since this is an optional test, I chose not to take the risk of connecting my son's papers with his genetic information, even with the layered security system they describe. Amazon was incredibly gracious and offered to refund the cost of the test even though we'd already opened it and started the process. Hopefully this will help others avoid the situation.",2018-07-24 00:00:00
TellmeGen,,Quick response and results,Laurie Beckstrand,,,19,5.0,I have just received my results from tellmegen and I’m very excited to review it. I had trouble initially registering my account. I sent an email and got a response back immediately. When does that ever happen? Very pleased with their quick response. My results have come back sooner than I expected. I can highly recommend this product and company so far. I’m hoping to be able to identify why I have so many mysterious symptoms that nobody can figure out!,2018-06-27 00:00:00
TellmeGen,,Cool and interesting health information!,Annette Baird,,,16,4.0,"The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is that it takes a long time to get the report after the sample is received. (4-6 weeks) This is noted on the website in the details, but not very clear at first.
The test is simple to do (spit in the tube) and their customer service is very good. They clarified that you don't need to have the sample picked up immediately, so don't stress about scheduling the pickup. In my case, UPS picked up my kit, this was a little annoying because while the pickup was scheduled for a certain time, UPS came several hours later in the day. I ended up leaving the package & paperwork for them to pickup and did not have any issues.
The report is very extensive and covers diseases ,inherited conditions, drug compatibility and general traits. (it doesn't give you ancestry information, but I was more interested in the health information which is why I chose this company).
The high level information on diseases is pretty clear it gives you the research status of the gene connection to the disease, your probability for getting the disease, the average probability and your increased likelihood (1.5x) of getting this based on your results. The results are sorted by high risk (>1.2x), low risk (<0.8x) and then average (0.8-1.2x), with the items with the most clinical evidence supporting the relationship at the top of the various lists. They encourage you to discuss diseases with >2.0x with your doctor. The summary reports can be downloaded in pdf. However, additional details are available on line including references and links to the technical papers where the research into the relationship between the gene and disease was identified. The items have varying levels of detail and descriptions with some having nice general descriptions that are easily understood by the layperson and others only having technical descriptions and links to the papers. For items with multiple genes, it is not clear how individual probabilities are used to calculate your probability for that disease.
Also, before viewing the results you can choose not to view certain items if you don't want to know your chances for those.
The data security and confidentiality appears to be very good. You register your test kit serial number (alpha numeric with upper & lower case). Only you have the link between the test kit and your name/information. You can grant access to your information to a health care professional who will have a separate log in. I haven't done this, so I don't know how easy it is.
You can also request consultations for additional fees (in Euro) varying from 20-150 Euro. In my case, I didn't see the need to do this.
They say that the results are reanalyzed when you log in, so if there are updates to the research that add more information, you can get that later. I'm not sure if they will email any updates, you probably should check back in 6-12 months to see if additional data is available.
You can also download the raw data of the DNA testing for other uses. I'm not sure what, but it is good that they acknowledge that the data is yours and you can do what you like with it.
Overall it appears to be a very good test for health related information. The other kits I looked at had much less health information available and were ""static"". I am still digging into the details of the reports, but am very pleased with my selection of the kit and the information provided.",2018-09-26 00:00:00
TellmeGen,,Much more than I was looking for!,H D,,,24,5.0,"After comparing several tests available on Amazon, I opted for this because of the large number of diseases it shows. I find much more useful information than knowing my ancestors (this kit does not offer such service, a pity), but in that aspect tellmegen has no rival .. It has helped me a lot to understand how I am and what body type I have, what things I tolerate better and which ones should take more care, which is always an advantage.
In my opinion, the best thing is that the information is updated for free as new advances in medicine are emerging and that is only offered by this company.
The kit arrived in perfect conditions as can be seen in the photos.
To put a negative note, the process of sending the sample may be a bit slow, but from what I have seen, they follow the same mechanism as the other companies in the sector.",2018-03-03 00:00:00
TellmeGen,,They made it very easy to ship to them and as a medical professional,Amazon Customer,,,16,5.0,"Don’t be afraid that this company is in Spain.

I highly recommend this product to guide us in wise lifestyle choices for our future years.",2018-07-22 00:00:00
TellmeGen,,A Valuable Test!,Nizel A.,,,26,5.0,"The turnaround to get my initial results was pretty quick, took about two weeks from when they received it vs the 6-8 months I was expecting. I had a few problems initially dealing with them, but they’ve worked diligiently to correct them. *Note Promethease currently does not support tellmegen, but I’ve been told they will within the next few weeks

The technical reports explain what each disease is and exactly what genes were tested as well as cite case studies as to why the genes are connected to each condition. They were even able to tell my hair & eye color so you know the data is legit. The pharmacogenetics have helped me tremendously as far as medication especially since I was taking some medications that showed have a negative effect on me. They were also able to tell what vitamin deficiencies I have as well.

Overall, my experience with tellmegen has been positive and they’ve definitely made an effort to correct any issues I’ve had come up. This test is a must have for everyone, as it has great value. If they added in an ancestry test it'd be even more valuable!",2018-04-17 00:00:00
TellmeGen,,BEST DNA GENETIC TESTING KIT,Kayleigh P.,,,10,5.0,"After carefully researching several DNA genetic testing kits options, I chose Tellmegen for the extensive testing they provide. The cost of $160 is reasonable for this extensive testing, and the fact they update automatically at no additional cost when new advances and discoveries are made is a huge plus, and well worth the initial cost.

Registering online and providing my sample was easy, and no cost to me to ship to the company in Spain. It took exactly 6 weeks from the date Tellmegen received my sample, to the date I received my results.

I was most interested in my “complex diseases” results and predisposition to certain illnesses. They provide in-depth information for each high-risk disease including “prevention,” “genetic role” and a “technical report.” Although there is no ancestry testing at this time, they expect to offer it in the near future and my previously submitted DNA sample will be tested at no additional cost to me. I also like the fact that Tellmegen has extensive online professional support. I highly recommend Tellmegen!",2018-09-13 00:00:00

I have all the scientific details regarding my genetic DNA & drug reactions that I will take to my physician. I’m hopeful the cost of my report will be absorbed by the reduced cost of other medical testing to diagnose illness. I feel in control of my own health now & I’m armed with medical knowledge! This is the real deal!",2018-11-01 00:00:00
TellmeGen,,Friendly customer service & easy to follow step by step instructions,Isabel ,,,8,5.0,"I had doubts before purchasing this kit, which is why I contacted the seller. Tellmegen was really fast in replying to the email I had send them. They were very friendly and patient with me, and pointed out the advantages of this kit over the other kits available on the market and convinced me. The fact that this kit would offer me more results than other kits was why I finally chose it.

I personally liked, that the kit has a sticker-seal on it, so I was sure it has not been opened before. This was important to me, to make sure everything was hygenic and of course I wanted to be sure the results were gonna be accurate.

Instructions are included in the kit, and it was very simple to just follow them. Literally anyone can do it. The kit also includes instructions on how to send the sample to the laboratory, which is really simple and is not gonna cause any additional costs, but is included in what you have paid already.

I am now looking forward receiving my results in only 3 to 4 weeks!",2018-06-11 00:00:00
TellmeGen,,Not the results I anticipated,J. Wessel,,,6,5.0,We have oodles of health issues that riddle our family so I anticipated seeing those since most of those ailments can be genetic. Not one. Not one ailment showed but something else did which after some reading into can actually result in those other issues. I found humor in seeing I only carry blue eye genes while I am not blue eyed. But the probability of having red headed kids is high which is correct. I shared my results with my family which were very eager to know. I also learned about the drug sensitivities which startled me yet now makes sense. I can hardly wait to learn more.,2018-10-13 00:00:00

TellmeGen,,AMAZING RESULTS!!!,mikela,,,3,5.0,"DETAILED ANCESTRY RESULTS NOW, YAY!!! FORGET ABOUT 23& ME TEST!

So I have done both tests...this one & 23&me. This test is BY FAR more detailed & contains WAY MORE INFORMATION!!! The ancestry information for instance...this test has 3 diff Russian groups, 6 diff Pakistan, 5 diff Chinese...and that's just what I noticed at a glance! My 23&me test results were interesting, I did that test first, I had NO clue as to what 'mix' I am. But the results were really very generalized. This test was just amazing! VERY detailed & gives you information about the group of people found in your ancestry.

The results were similar to 23&me, but I found that 23&me had a lot of %'s noted in vast area & then they would say 'DNA found, but not able to determine exactly which ethnic group'. That didn't happen with Tell me Gen! They tell you where your DNA comes from, LOVE IT!!! THANK YOU!!! 23&me does hook you up with relatives & Tell me Gen does not, but maybe that's next?

On to the drug results (6 pages)...this test will tell you how so many different drugs metabolize in your body! You can take this test with you to the dr & actually use it for future use, or look at what drugs you are on now & see if there is a better drug you could be on! That's actually pretty awesome! If you have cancer...there are a TON of cancer drugs listed, which I found to be really interesting & thought could actually be a life saver!

There was 3 pages of TRAITS!!! And they weren't just stupid nonsense traits either...Alcohol addiction, Caffeine & Anxiety, Drug Abuse, Memory, Gambling Behavior, Sex hormone regulation, Pain sensitivity, Stature...the list goes on & on!!! LOVED IT!!!

Inherited Conditions- 4 pages- These are diseases & such you could have inherited....Breast & Ovarian Cancers, Cystic Fibrosis, Gaucher disease, so many things I've never heard of, nor can pronounce, extremely detailed!

Complex Diseases- 7 PAGES!!!
It lists these in categories in which you are at high risk, low risk & typical risk.
There are SO MANY interesting & important diseases listed!!!
Heart Attack, Diabetes, Crohn's, Gout, Thyroid Cancer, Alcohol w/d Seizures, Bipolar Disorder, Schizophrenia, Periodontitis, Allergic Asthma, Psoriasis, Autism, Narcolepsy, NUMEROUS types of Breast Cancers, Parkinson's, Depression, Cataracts, Pancreatic Cancer...THERE'S SO MANY, I WISH I COULD LIST THEM ALL!!!

We have tested several family members b/c of serious illnesses, & b/c the medication information has proven to be so very important already!! We are currently waiting on 2 test results, one being my 1 y/o grandson. YES! We are going to test the baby & see what it shows & also see what vaccinations he could have reactions to....or could possibly react to when given at the same time. I have found this test to be PRICELESS!!!

NO PASSPORT NEEDED TO DO THIS TEST FROM THE USA! We have now sent in several tests, including the one for a baby. The test for the baby required proof from one of the parents, like a DL, stating their name, and something with the baby's name on it, my daughter in law used his birth card, or birth cert...I'm not sure which.

I damaged one kit in transit, they sent me another - no problem. I needed it shipped to a different address - no problem. I combined by two kits when I sent them back - no problem. They could not have been more helpful.

TellmeGen,,great kit. very detailed.,terricam,,,0,4.0,"likes: the information was extensive. stated all traits and carriers and stated genetic markers. got to know percentages of ancestry results and exact tribes or subgroups. it was wonderful to know the sub ethnicities that my traits came from as well. updates: this site updates without requesting further information or extra charge. that is an excellent perk.
dislikes: language. it kept defaulting to Spanish. it was difficult to get the site to stay in English so that i could navigate it properly. time. it took so long for results to come back and i was not notified when they got ancestry results. notifications. i had been waiting for them for months but had no idea they updated their site. mailing. struggled with the labels. had to contact them several times to get them. but they did finally come through. downloading. this was only with the ancestry site. i couldn't download or print the results neither could i transfer them and compare with other sites. that was disappointing. dont know which dna they used: i don't know if they used xdna y dna or somatic dna. have no idea exactly which branch the percentages are from. for a kit i paid such a high cost for (over 200.00) i expected this to be better put together. but i was glad that it was at least working online.
overall: the site appears to have a few bugs but they are minor. it seems that it is not as popular as other sites yet so there may be more improvement in the future. its wonderfully extensive in its explanations and descriptions. it automatically updates making it worth the money if you don't mind waiting.",2019-01-19 00:00:00

Even though I had to wait a bit for the results, I think it was clearly worth it!. The results are VERY comprehensive and gave me great insights into some things I was aware of and others I was not aware of.

And of course, the traits listed validated in my case (eye/hair color/height predictions were very accurate ). Also, they listed a higher risk of rotator cuff injury which also is very accurate in my case. Yeah, and I learned about Restless Legg Syndrome. I didn't know it had a name, now I have an excuse when my wife complains :)

The information in the results is very comprehensive. It's confidential, secure, and available online anytime.

I would like to see more nutrition-related information, but I spoke with a rep and they said to expect a lot more nutrigenomics related data before Christmas. They continually add information to your results as new discoveries and data become available.

I highly recommend this kit for anyone looking to:
- Gain a peace of mind
- Have insight into foods and drugs to avoid and ones to optimize targeted results
- Learn their predisposition to certain diseases and conditions along with suggested steps to take
- Potentially extend and increase the quality of their life.
- Looking for a super cool and unique gift to give someone

TellmeGen,,As thorough as it gets!,BoyMomX3,,,0,5.0,"I had a very pleasant experience with tellmegen! Not only were their instructions clear as day (my biggest fear was messing up getting my DNA to them) my DNA kit was received lightening fast by them. The results took a couple weeks, but I was sent an email about their completion. After logging in into my personal and secure account, I was able to pull up my results right away. They are VERY thorough, detailed and spot on from what I know from my personal family history. It was very interesting to learn about myself, which will help me be healthier in the future as I know what I am more prone to.

The customer service at Tellmegen is amazing and very prompt in their response. I will definitely be ordering kits for my family members.

Thank you Tellmegen!!!",2019-01-03 00:00:00

The process for submitting DNA was SO EASY. After registering the tube to my account, I asked for a shipping label, and emailed to arrange to have the box picked up for shipping. I didn't have to leave the house.

I've had bypass surgery and rare incidents of AFib as well as a few other health problems. My doctor was able to see from Tellmegen's results that I am a slow metabolizer of metoprolol and therefore could do with a lower dose of that drug. This seems to have solved some of the problems I've been having. There is a great deal of information in the results.

TellmeGen,,Thorough and clear DNA report,reader25,,,3,5.0,"The results arrived just at the 6 week date, and I was very happy with the report. It is extensive and thorough. I bought this kit because it reported on more genetic markers than I could find from any of the US companies/products. The company is in Spain, and I believe they are allowed to report more markers than here in the US. They show the basic result, then general information on the disease/trait, and then a scientific report on your specific results. This is much more than I expected. They add information on your report as they have the ability to read the gene marker, and I believe they contact you monthly with new information. I contacted them via email with a number of questions and they responded within a few hours. This is highly unusual in my experience. So, though I only received my results a week ago, so far I am very happy with this product.",2018-10-31 00:00:00

You send in your sample and they send you a confirmation for every step. You must register your kit online in order to receive the results. Results usually show up in 4-6 weeks.

They are pretty detailed. I knew most of the details from previous DNA tests. But was surprised by a few things like my disposition for diabetes and the genetic snip for SCADD. My nutritionist has always been intrigued by my “heroic metabolism” for carbs and my inability to eat a lot of animal protein. SCADD means I had a hard time metabolizing fat and need a constant stream of energy in the form of easily available carbs.

It was cool a-ha moment. And also explained why Keto/Paleo/Intermittent fasting never worked for me.

Another validation was another genetic snip that said I don’t respond to diabetes meds. Which allowed me to go to my doc and look for alternatives to Metformin to help with PCOS triggered insulin resistance.

I will update this review once I get my results, but I am thrilled that they will have so much health information to share from just my saliva sample.

Update: I finally got my results and I I'm so happy with them! I love how much information there is and that I can actually consult with someone to understand it further. I'm looking forward to giving this information to my doctor so we can work together to take care of my health as best as we can.

My results came in about 3 weeks, both negative. I also booked an appointment with the counselor, but it was rather useless, the results are pretty much self explanatory. I am still waiting for other parts of the results that would tell me it I have things dairy intolerance etc. I guess this test is a quick and reliable way to find out if you have some common cancers genes mutation, since it would be rather impossible to convince a conventional doctor to do something like this.",2018-08-10 00:00:00

Color Genetic Risk Test,,No Raw Data,Chumley,,,21,1.0,"For only slightly more money, you can get Whole Exome Sequencing from other companies. I mistakenly assumed that I could access my raw data for these specific genes with Color's services because they market themselves as providing consumers access to important genetic health information. Wrong. You only receive their analysis report and cannot access your own genetic data that they have sequenced. They claim that they will update you on any new scientific developments that affect your genes, or you can subscribe to an expensive service to have them report on any new genes they decide to add to their service (no guarantees this will happen). If I could do it again, I would pay a little more for WGS that I can store myself and give to my medical providers and that reports on all protein-encoding genes, not just one interpretation of a small subset of encoding genes.",2018-09-03 00:00:00

Color Heriditary Cancer Test,,"Easy to understand, guides you through the process in an approachable and calm way",Lauren C.,,,66,5.0,"I'd procrastinated on taking the test for a year. My doctor had recommended the BRCA to me, based on the fact that my maternal grandmother died in her mid-30s of breast cancer. I'm in my mid-30s now. I also don't know a lot about my family's history for a variety of reasons. So it made sense to have my DNA looked at and to have some understanding of my risk. I waited a year because it was scary, sure. But also because of the cost. Because I didn't have two family members (that I was aware of) with breast cancer, insurance wouldn't cover it. My doctor recommended a blood test that was going to run me $300. So I gave myself a few reasons to avoid it. Then one day, Amazon suggested to me to get the Color BRCA test. At $100 I really couldn't sneeze at the price. Then I got $100 gift certificate to Amazon for Christmas. My excuses were gone. It was time to do the scary thing.

Color made the whole process so easy to understand and it really helped put me at ease. I'm not sure I'll ever be as chill as the lady from the video, spitting into a tube for a cancer test like it's no big deal, but it made things approachable in a calm and informative way. Like other reviewers, I had my results back a week earlier than expected. My biggest worry was that they would send me an email and there I'd be at the grocery store or work when - bam. I'd just have it pop up in my face unavoidably. Color addresses this nicely. I got an email saying my results were ready. Once I logged in to the site, there was another video explaining this next part and revisiting some of what had already been covered. They made it very clear that Color is not a cancer diagnosis. It is information to take to your doctor to make informed decisions. After the video and some reading, Color has you check a box, saying you're in a private place. They make sure you're ready.

I was fortunate and did not have the mutation; the result most people get. If I had, Color had sent the results to my doctor already so we could have started discussing my next steps right away. I felt prepared. I still was nervous, but not because of anything Color said or did. I still have to keep an eye out for problems, given my family history, but at least I'm armed with a bit more information. As the technology evolves, I might look into other testing to see what else my DNA can tell me.

My well wishes for all who pursue knowing their BRCA results. It's scary but hopefully taking advantage of this or any other kind of early detection can help you lead a long and healthy life.",2018-01-28 00:00:00
Color Heriditary Cancer Test,,Best way to get BRCA1 and BRCA2 on your own.... Excellent test for the money.,Benegesserit,,,30,5.0,"This is a great genetic test for the money. I am a physician so I ordered it for myself. The fact that you get the BRCA1 and 2 SEQUENCED and not just a look for ""certain mutations"" was the biggest plus. For this price you can't go wrong. It is worth the money. WAY less expensive than getting the BRCA1 and 2 even with insurance (and it takes FOREVER to do that and you have to get a prior authorization and see a genetics councilor of which there are way too few in the world). I am very happy to have found this and recommend it to my patients. The other tests are just a bonus as far as I am concerned. Most of them look for known mutations and are not gene sequencing. Remember though, you are opening Pandora's box with this one... if you find something positive it might scare the pants off you, so be ready for that possibility. That is why a doctor has to ""order"" it for you. Though the company provides this to you if you do not have a doctor willing to do it for you. It is very easy for your doctor to sign up to prescribe it though... I did it. Took a few minutes. The company then sends you an email to invite you to do the test on behalf of your doctor's order. You then just enter the code from your test box that you got thru amazon and it works perfectly. You can keep it out of your medical record if you go thru the company's doctor though... so that might be a consideration for some people. Remember if it gets into your medical record it would jeopardize applying for insurance in the future. Any type of insurance: Life, disability, health... you name it. Take care!",2018-09-16 00:00:00

Color Heriditary Cancer Test,,It always pays to check your options!,Laura Dial,,,26,5.0,"First, I want to say using Color for BRCA1 & 2 testing was extremely simple, fast and affordable. I felt that the website contained very helpful information and everything from the website to the testing materials were very easy to use. I was also happy that my results came back 2 weeks earlier than they had estimated. They even faxed the results to my doctor. On top of everything else the straightforward, reasonable pricing was very much appreciated. Below is my story about why I sought testing and how I ended up choosing Color.

After being diagnosed with breast cancer I was originally referred to another testing lab (a lab that once had a monopoly on testing BRCA1 & 2) and was told that this was a $5,000 test. I knew that my high deductible BCBS plan would cover 80% of the cost, leaving me with 20% of whatever the negotiated rate would be. Thinking that this was a simple question, I called this other facility and asked what my cost would be. They were very cagey about what my costs would be and just kept telling me that most people only pay about $50 out of pocket. They explained that the way they operate is that I send in the sample, they test it and check with my insurance, then they contact me about payment. If the cost is too high, they will just not share the results... Sounds like emotional blackmail to me! Despite their assurances, I insisted that they estimate my cost and the rep I spoke to had to get a supervisor's permission to do so. My portion would have been nearly $800 which was a far cry from the $50 they said was most common. My husband and I did some searching and found many others who were unhappy with the approach of this lab and also found the Color website. Color was clear, affordable and reputable, so we went with this option. I also educated my doctor's office about this more affordable option. My doctor was please with the report that was sent to him.

I saved $700 and learned that I do not have the mutations. I will be using that money to go toward my lumpectomy instead of lining the pockets of whoever runs that other lab!",2017-12-11 00:00:00

Color Heriditary Cancer Test,,Important Information,C Larson,,,12,5.0,"I bought this because when I uploaded my raw data from Living DNA to Promethease, it said I had a BRCA2 variant. If I really had it, I wanted to know. Each DNA testing company uses different SNPs. I did not have BRCA variants on 23andMe, but they only test for three variants that are most common in Ashkenazi Jews. There are more than 1000 BRCA variants known to increase cancer risk. The majority of BRCA variants in the general population, 23andMe does not currently test for.
The Promethease report was a shock. I've tested with several DNA companies, uploaded my raw data, and this was the first time anything about BRCA showed up. I ordered the Color test because I wanted to find out if this information was accurate or a false positive. The first saliva sample I sent, they were not able to use. I'm not sure why, but they have strict quality controls. They sent me a second kit and that time it worked. Thankfully, my results came back that I did not have any BRCA mutations. I'm sharing this in case anyone else finds BRCA on their Promethease report. It could be a false positive like mine was.",2018-07-07 00:00:00

Luckily my test came back negative.

The test itself was so easy to take, the instructions were very clear. Just provide the saliva, and mail it back in the prepaid box. I received my results much sooner than expected, it only took about 2 weeks. Because my results were negative, I did not take advantage of the personal consultation, but it was offered to me.

I tested positive for a mutation on my MSH6 gene. The genetic counselor was amazing in helping me understand my results and how to proceed with them. She explained that because of my mutation I have a condition called Lynch Syndrome. This syndrome makes my chances of getting various cancers raise to as much as 80% and it can strike at very young ages. One of those is colon cancer, which my mother passed away from at 59. I have 4 children and they have a 50% chance of inheriting the mutation. Color is amazing and they offer $50 testing for all of your adult 1st degree relatives if you test positive. I have 2 above 18 that can test now and 2 below 18. My Father, brother and sister who is already a cancer survivor since the age of 46, can also get tested at this price. Their test results will tell us if their children need testing. This test most likely saved multiple lives in my family. I am already scheduled at a top cancer hospital near me to meet with genetic counselors and an oncologist who specializes in Lynch Syndrome. I have a lot of screenings ahead of me and most likely preventative surgeries. I’m going to do everything I can to stay alive and that wouldn’t have been possible without this test. If you’re on the fence about doing it because of the price, just do it $250 or less on sale is nothing to pay to save your life.",2018-07-15 00:00:00

I was thrilled with the low price offered by Amazon...however, the peace of mind I received from the results was priceless. My father passed away from colon cancer before the age of 60 and I have always worried that a genetic mutation was passed on to me. Thank goodness I tested negative. I had a screening colonoscopy done this week and everything looked good. So, those results combined with my Color results have helped alleviate worries and stress. I have been diagnosed with Atypical Ductal Hyperplasia and was also curious as to whether or not I also had a mutation with the BRCA...that also was negative. I realize that I am still at risk for developing breast cancer due to the hyperplasia but it was a relief to discover there was not a genetic mutation. I will continue with routine screenings but am very thankful to know that I do not have any of the genetic mutations tested. I am so glad I took the test.

The Color test results came back in a couple of weeks, and were very clear and thorough. They use a different method than 23andMe and are much more precise.
The Color team reached out to me about the SNP code for the BRCA2 result from 23andMe, and made certain to focus on that portion of the sequence, which really made me feel like they really care about accurate data and how you receive it. I ended up testing negative for the issue found by 23andme, so it was a very easy experience for me in that regard. If I had tested positive, they have many resources for genetic counseling.
I would definitely recommend Color. They are VERY affordable and provide accurate results quickly.",2018-04-03 00:00:00

Color Heriditary Cancer Test,,As accurate as Myriad's,ABibliophile,,,3,5.0,"I found a lump in my breast a year ago. After an ultrasound and biopsy, I discovered I had fibrocystic breasts (it was benign). But it did get me thinking about my family history. I'm adopted so I had to reach out to my biological mother and, in turn, found out my maternal grandmother was diagnosed with breast cancer at age forty five. I asked my insurance if I was able to take the Hereditary Cancer test (Myriad MyRisk) and they told me I needed to set an appointment with a genetic counselor who would assess my eligibility. Turns out that most genetic counselors are backed up for months! So, I bought this test instead. Color received my saliva sample on July 11 and I had my results July 23. Thankfully, they were negative. In the interim, I found a kind doctor who was able to give me the Myriad test without the genetic counseling. I submitted my blood sample and, in four business days, I had my results-negative. The only difference between the reports was a risk score on Myriad's that was pretty useless for me since I don't know my father's history. Also, the Myriad test costs $4,050 and provides no genetic counseling. I've read a lot about Color's lab process and it's almost identical to Myriad's, if not superior. This is a really great option if insurance won't cover you. I think it's a great public service that everyone has access to preventative care, not just the insured or those who know their exact lineage.",2018-07-24 00:00:00

I was most interested in doing this test to learn about weight loss based on my dna and improving my overall health. The report was able to tell me that based on a certain gene that I may have a reduced ability to feel full when I am eating. My dna also says that I have a reduced risk of gaining weight back once I lose it, so hopefully if what I learned helps, I can keep up the results! There were also many other recommendations just for me, this is just one that stood out to me.

I also learned that in terms of exercise I am more likely than other people to lose weight from exercising – and so I am hoping some more time fitting in physical activities into my day will help boost weight loss.

I was also recommended supplements and a detailed explanation of why these supplements would be best for me based on my genetics/lifestyle/health. I will be adding the recommended vitamins to my regimen.

On the ancestry part of the test I received the same amount of detail as my mom did in her report from a different company. When I decided to go with this product I was concerned it might not be as detailed.

The box it comes in is used to ship it back. It even came with a prepaid return label which was pretty neat.

I wasn't too sure what to expect, but the results were very comprehensive.

The diet section was educational and surprised me in a good way. I learned a lot the types of foods that work for me, but more interestingly it was my body's reaction to exercise and food in combination that was most helpful. I am a regular runner and since have changed my routine based on my DNA (which says I am more of a sprinter). I started doing more a track short burst runs and cut back on lipids and fats which is not a good fit for me based on my DNA. I adjusted my vitamins based on my DNA and added methylated B12 and fish oil.

I got my detailed ""report"" today, and there is very little value here that I'm guessing cannot be obtained for free from a high school health class textbook, common knowledge and websites like webmd or Mayo. When I first ordered this I complained about how long it took to get a response. After I posted, within hours it was reported that my kit was received. The owner then called me and asked me to retract my negative review, which I did. The ""report"" is very long, but the information is so general and very little is based on my actual saliva sample. The part which is indeed based on my sample involves technical names of genes which are poorly explained. Some of the info on me is flat out wrong - I don't have low iron, and the recommendation CoQ10 when taking a statin is, in my opinion and my doctor's, too low. Unless you left school in 3rd or 4th grade, there is very little you don't already know in this report like exercising is good for you. The health aspect of this, like I say, is too general to be of much value to me. The ""supplement"" recommendations - outside of the one of African mango - are things already contained in any good diet or good multi-vitamin, actually a good mult-ivitamin is superior to these recommendations. As far as the genealogical part, it is at some variance with a firm like Ancestry.com, which was much more detailed - and more correct. I'm not mad. I took a gamble on Vitagene and lost.

But now I have a reason to get my butt to the gym more often if it's gonna help me more than just eating like a rabbit. Some of the other info I know by experience, like how I can drink a espresso after dinner and still go to sleep, but it was neat knowing that my DNA is what does that.

Getting the suggestions about which vitamins would work best for me was helpful too. I don't like taking meds so I try to do the natural thing. I never thought about taking magnesium before but seeing how it could help my headaches and potty issues now I'm gonna try it.",2017-03-28 00:00:00

It was not as long as I had anticipated based on other reviews and only took me a few minutes. After abut a month, I got my results which came by email as 5 separate reports that you can view in your online dashboard when you set up your account.

Genetic Traits report-gives you a breakdown on how you metabolize alcohol, sodium intake and it's effects on blood pressure, caffeine metabolism, gluten sensitivity, how you metabolize food, lactose intolerance, cholesterol traits, and exercise traits.

This was interesting information but it used sentences like-""your body may tolerate lactose, you may be able to eat foods with gluten and not have digestive issues"" and then would give basic statistics that you could find online about each subject. It just seemed a little vague to me.

It had a supplement report discussing which supplements would benefit me and why. I thought this report had good information. Yes, if you desire, you can order supplements from them, but it did not push it in this report at all.

Diet Report talks about your BMI, how many calories you should consume in a day, how much protein, how many glasses of water and also suggested some foods to eat that would give you the nutrients you need. You may be able to find some of this online, but I liked having it all together written out for me.

Diet Report-talked about how many calories you should plan on burning a week and based on your questionnaire and what you listed for the forms of exercise you use, listed how much time you would need to spend on that exercise to burn those calories.

Ancestry Report-This gives basic regional information here. I would have liked to see more info and details here.

There is also an option to meet for a nutritional consultation and then an option to purchase supplements from them, but it did not seem pushy at all to me, as it wasn't addressed in my individual reports, as mentioned in other reviews.

Overall, it gave some good information but I would have liked it a little bit more specific in some areas.",2018-05-16 00:00:00
CellMaxLife,,"Completed a little sooner than literature suggests, and results were pretty complete, though maybe not what I expected.",Amazon Customer,,,4,4.0,"Arrived in the mail exactly on schedule, test with swabs was easy to do, if a little boring. No sense of excitement like on CSI. Vitagene was good about updating status, though I think I only got one email with the update, the one saying the results were ready to download. Setting up a web account was easy, questions a little lengthy but probably needed. Results appeared a little sooner than suggested, so that was good. I am not sure what I was expecting to see in results, but ancestry roots were there, listed to areas of world, so not so specific as I think I was anticipating: listed as like north and western Europe, while I think I was expecting something more like Danish and British. Explanation talks about the extreme inter-mingling of European areas through centuries of migration and conquests so I understand why this is not more specific, just would like that anyway. The rest was interesting, big focus on health issues, but not what I think I was expecting. I think I was expecting more tendencies to like heart problems, Alzheimers, like that, which were asked for in the question section, so just would have parroted that back, I suppose. No, this was more suggestions of vitamin and mineral deficiencies which could be helped with diet, exercise changes, and supplements. Results were well-explained, just maybe not in a way that made sense to me. For example, to say I share a tendency to low B12 with 46% of the population...ok, do I need it or not? Seemed a little more like my wife nagging at me to eat more leafy greens and get out of the house and get some exercise. Ok, I probably do need more exercise and sun, but, well, more spinach and kale likely might not make the list. I did feel a little push to purchasing supplements from or through them, but it was not over-bearing and has not been followed up, so possibly just a service that they can provide.",2017-07-20 00:00:00

CellMaxLife,,Super Simple Process!,Annie Eaton,,,5,5.0,"I'm very impressed with this product and its ease of use. Other members of my family had gotten DNA tests completed for ancestry, but none of them included a health component! That's one of the reasons this DNA test was more exciting to me than most others. The product arrived quickly (gotta love Amazon Prime) and I was able to turn it around in just a matter of days.

One tip - make sure you swab for DNA when you wake up and before you brush your teeth or drink any water. The instructions recommend this and I forgot about it the first morning so I waited another day.

The packaging is simple and elegant, with all of the elements gently wrapped in tissue paper. You take the swabs and roll them around the insides of your cheeks and break the tips off into the small vials. They require two samples just to be safe. The best part about the whole process was that the packaging included a pre-made return label, so no hassle there!

Overall great experience and I can't wait to see what my ancestry is, as well as my health profile!

EDIT: I got my results back (pretty quickly) and am so excited! My ancestry came back more or less as expected, but I did have some interesting parts of the world included like Central Asia and West Middle East. The biggest differentiator of this test is the health component. I was pleased to find how comprehensive it was and it even revealed my slow caffeine metabolism. This explains why I've always had higher sensitivity to caffeine and I had no idea why until I got these results. I'm likely going to try some of their other products (like Smart Supplements) that pair with my personal DNA test results and see if that improves certain aspects of my health. I would definitely recommend this test.",2017-09-06 00:00:00

You should not purchase this kit if you want anything other than a basic ""where ya from?"" DNA analysis. I should have stuck with an actual ancestry kit. Anyway so my mom and I both found out that we are Caucasian Europeans. Imagine that! Take a other $80 and yell me what color our hair is! What this test should be used for is health. It's nothing that a Dr. couldn't tell you from a physical but it's cheaper and more convenient I suppose. But even that didn't give me much to go off of because you fill out this long survey online that give you all of the health crap anyway. Q: Do you feel depressed at times? A: yes, sometimes. Result: you may suffer from depression and may benefit from taking St. John's Wort, on sale now at our shop for only $19.95. It's a silly kit. You get what you pay for.",2018-07-17 00:00:00

What was even more fascinating was the health results. I'm an active runner and I work out from time-to-time. Although. I've never been at my target weight since college. My report stated that I'm more likely to experience weight loss from dieting, than just exercise. I put so much of my focus on cardio the last couple years and eat whatever I wanted. I had no idea my specific gene for exercise response had something to do with this! Makes a whole ton of sense! There is a wealth of other health information but I'm EXCITED to focus on dieting!

Okay, to improve, increase the price and make the pre survey easier, it took me 3 hours, because I have other things to do. l need all, all, all! info in written form as well as online, no piecing it out.

There are a ton of different brands, a bazillion different tests, and everything is all over the map in terms of price. I chose the Vitagene kit because of reviews and personal recommendations. It was surprisingly easy to use--swap the inside of each cheek two times, put the swap in a vial, shake, put in bag, send off for testing. That's it.

I actually completely forgot about the testing but a month later, all of my info showed up! It was seamless and easy, and the product I got back was awesome. It wasn't just information on heritage--it also gave you info on health, too. I couldn't be more pleased. I'm still debating if I want to spend more money trying another kit, but I can't recommend this one enough. For the price, you absolutely get great bang for your buck, and it's so easy!

Not only did my Vitagene genetic testing results provide me with information about my ancestry, but I also learned what types of diets, exercises and supplements are best for my unique body.

Purchasing Vitagene over Amazon was very straightforward, easy and I was pleased with how quickly the testing kit was delivered to my address. The kit came in cute, yet professional packaging and contained instructions that laid out the process clearly.

After sending in my DNA samples, I received my results in only a few weeks. The results came in a comprehensive report which outlined my ancestry and how my body will likely react to different diets and types of exercise. This process has been very interesting and has sparked my interest in genetics-based nutrition. As it said in my comprehensive Vitagene report, ""One study presented in 2014 found that participants placed on a genetics-based diet on average experienced 33% more weight loss than those given generic diet plans.""

The first thing that surprised me was when they provided my full raw DNA file and I noticed the file included over 700,000 SNP's and included MTHFR mutations, I was very happy to see this included for $99. Back in November I purchased 23andme's $199 kit for me and my wife and it did not include any reporting on the MTHFR gene. This was a hidden value of this test for me and I bet there are a lot of people that don't realize the extra value of what type of DNA file this kit provides and Vitagene should advertise that this is specifically included with their DNA test. I was lucky to have done some research myself on the differences between DNA files and would have not known what I received was so useful otherwise. Some of the information included was basic general diet guidelines that most doctors would recommend, which makes since and expected and was happy I looked further into my reports and was pleasantly surprised to see a lot of information that I have never received from any doctor and bet it would have cost me a fortune if I had my metabolizing and intolerance tests done by my doctor.

I got more supplements suggested than information to back them up. AND they didn't even use the two genes most commonly discussed in research about body weight/obesity/exercise. It makes no sense. The kind of stuff it told me: how I metabolize alcohol, caffeine, and that I may or may not do well with dairy and gluten and a couple of generic exercise details, but nothing clearly related to a specific gene. Also the ancestry data is as generic as what I could guess on my own--even more so actually. I could gauge more from a family tree than this. Whereas you learn if you have the gene linked with celiac with 23andme and get further breakdowns on ancestry with both the other two big providers--you can even connect with living relatives if you choose to. I wasn't focused on ancestry which is why I chose this one, so I expected it to be heavily detailed in relation to health based on how it describes itself, but it's just not worth the money.

CellMaxLife,,Good deal at $40... don't pay more. Wait for a sale.,D. White,,,2,2.0,"I'll update this as the results come in.

The fairly fluffy ""vitamin advice"" offerings of this product are really secondary and I don't plan to look at them. Getting the raw data file is what makes it worth having. That file can then be uploaded to any number of other sites, some free, to give really good analysis of the health implications of your 700k+ SNPs.

However, I don't appreciate the fact that Amazon offers no ""price protection"", and that this product's price seems to randomly rise and fall. You can buy it, have the price drop 20significantly without prior notice, and not be able to get any sort of ""price protection"" from Amazon, which they used to honor. So I paid $56 last week and now it's $40. It dropped significantly the day after we bought it, and amazon said ""tough"". Which is absolutely their right to do, but it's important that the customer knows that's its new policy.

Will this product be $25 in a week? Or &75? No way to know, but you'll definitely feel stupid if you buy it and the next week it's half that price.

At $40 or less it may be the cheapest way to get your raw DNA data file, and a 5-star deal even if the ""vitamin"" stuff is silly. I'll add to this review after we get the results.",2018-05-06 00:00:00

CellMaxLife,,Total waste of money,k,,,4,1.0,Total waste of money! Everything it tells you is from a 7th grade health class. It asks you which suppliments you already take and then tries to sell you theirs. The ancestry part was the only intersting part but only gives general South Central Asia or Eastern European. Gives one liners like “you may be likely to have a gluton sensitivety” or “you are not likely to tolerate lactose”. Very general and not personal at all.

I was really excited based on other reviews and what the product said regarding Diet, Exercise, and Health! That's why I chose this versus the other DNA tests available on the market. Well I got my report this week, and the Diet, Exercise, and Supplement reports are Laughable. Let me Elaborate: Diet: Headlines include Alcohol Metabolism, Sodium Intake and Blood Pressure, Carbohydrate metabolism, Gluten Sensitivity, Eating Behavior, Fat Metabolism and Body Weight, Cholesterol levels, Triglyceride levels, and Body Weight. Under those, it lists ""Your Result"", and they all begin with ""You may have....."" Therefore it's useless. It gives me nothing concrete. I may have this or that ? What does that say ? I may or may not ? Very silly. The other details it gives you on Diet and Exercise are just based on the questionnaire. It's common sense, such as BMI, and what to eat based on your goals. It has nothing to do with your DNA, which is the whole reason you choose this versus some online questionnaire that is going to spit out generic results based on your answers. Exercise results are the same, all begin with ""you may"" or ""Your muscles may be"" What is this MAY stuff ? Those reports were a total waste of my time. They gave me no value whatsoever. Same with the Supplement plan, it's a ploy to get you to buy a 79$ a month subscription to their ""Smart Supplements"" program. Overall it gets two stars because of how I felt going into the report, I was super excited, I waited patiently for 6 weeks only to be let down by the report. The only interesting thing was the Ancestry Report, which showed me what I had already somewhat knew based on fact my Mom is from England and Dad from Italy.",2017-12-19 00:00:00

Please note that they will NOT process your DNA (saliva sample) without you answering the personal questions. If you value your privacy, then you can answer the questionnaire without looking at the multiple choice questions. The Genes and Genotypes should be solely based on the DNA and you can google for more info on that.

I can understand this and was willing to wait extra time, to verify and finish the ancestry report for which I paid. We were told,

""Our lab flagged your ancestry analysis for an additional round of quality assurance checks which we expect to be complete by Friday. We wanted to give you the health results ASAP so we uploaded those to your dashboard."" It's now 4/10/17 and there has still been no communication and no updates for the completed tests. In addition, I question if the second part of the test was mixed with my husbands. Not a happy customer. I did receive a printed hard copy report in the mail. Unfortunately it is not a full report for which I paid. If they knew my swab was pulled for a Quality Check, why did they send the report??",2017-04-10 00:00:00

CellMaxLife,,"Straightforward Process, Interesting Data",Adil,,,0,5.0,"SUPER straightforward. I was worried this would be some strange medical process or take lots of time, but the whole process took ~10 mins from unboxing.

The process is simple: you get a box with a couple of cotton swabs and container. You swab the inside of each cheek for a minute or two, stick the cotton into the provided safe containers, and then mail it back with the box and postage, all provided by vitagene.

Then you wait for your results, which come ~4 weeks later. They cover everything from ancestry to potential health issues.

CellMaxLife,,I paid $20 more ($80) 1month later= $60 :(,Jenni Igoe,,,5,2.0,"I ordered Vitagene on Amazon (31 days ago) but I should have waited. I paid $80, and all week it's been $61-65ish. Today, it's down to $60, and is unfair. Vitagene tells you do fill out the Questionaire right away, so you can't return it when the price goes down. It didn't Just go down to $60, but it's been $60-something ($17-20 LESS than what I paid) for the past week.

For now, I'm giving 2 Stars as I feel ripped off. Had I not already registered to do the questionnaire, I would be returning my unused kit (both swabs) & re-buy it for the current (Amazing) price of $60, right now. It is Definitely WORTH IT at such a low price!! Invest in yourself, find out what's best for your health genetically.

I will update my review after I contact the seller/Amazon about this issue. I believe Vitagene is a 5-Star product, but I'm off to a bad start. I work so hard for my money but I purchased it via my giftcard balance so no price protection. Otherwise, I'm excited to send my kit and get the results, and will give a detailed account of my experience via my blog & an updated review.

It even came with a pre-paid postage to send back which was awesome. The instructions were easily readable, but its the result that is mind blowing. You basically get a 50-something page book all about you, so basically its like kindergarten all over again! I found out that I'm more made up of my dad, when my whole life I thought I was more of my mom! 67% Irish, and I found out I even have some asian and southern American in me too!

They ask you heaps of health questions about yourself and the Health area they fill out ""off your DNA"" is nearly exactly as you answered the questions on their questionnaire.

They also didnt suggest anything for exercise because guess what? I didnt fill out that section in the questionnaire. When I click the button it tells me i need to fill out the questionnaire. Now tell me, if they are going strictly by DNA, why would they need my exercise habits to suggest what is right for my body by evaluating my genes/dna??? ...I was excited about this test because it was going to tell me stuff about myself that other DNA tests could not but it is a lie. They dont evaluate your DNA at all. It is all extracted off the questionnaire you take. Also, I didnt receive any book at all. This was a complete rip off and I want a refund!!!",2018-05-20 00:00:00

CellMaxLife,,Fantastic kit! Highly recommend.,Catherine,,,5,5.0,"I had previously done 23 & Me and while that was comprehensive it didn't give me information about how my body did with exercise and processed food. I was really curious about what the Vitagene kit would say. The process is very easy. They send you the kit, you do the mouth swabs and send the kit back.
It was 100% understandable that there was a delay in the kit getting to its location. The kit is sent to Houston and with everything going on there I wasn't expecting a fast delivery. Once they received my kit, I was sent a prompt e-mail telling me that it would take about 6-weeks to complete my processing. I completed the online survey about myself. I personally don't feel after reading the results of my test, that as some of the reviews say, it's a carbon copy of the answers filled out. I don't think they could've told me some of those things based on the questions answered.
They finished it in the time they said they would. I believe 23 & me is a 4-week period, so I didn't have an issue with the extra two weeks. It was an extremely comprehensive 72 page explanation of everything. I'm thrilled. It tells me some things that I guessed and other things I didn't know. I'm going to follow the advice given and look into some of the supplements they suggest to help. I have attached screenshots of some of the explanations and suggestions so you can get a partial idea. I highly recommend this to anyone who is interested.",2017-10-10 00:00:00

Great? Nope, they have a fitness and nutrition survey that they have you take, thats where they get all their answers. Not from the DNA.

Even the nutrition parts they claim are from the DNA are not scientific. Gluten intolerance for example.

This service basically charged me $50 for a report based on my goals, family history and current diet. All of the information that it gave me I had already from doing basic nutrition research online.

I don't recommend this service at all.",2018-08-25 00:00:00

Well you can't see the results until you fill out the diet and lifestyle questionnaire. Well anybody can take that questionnaire and put together a diet, exercise and supplement plan based solely on that. The try to make it look like it is a combination of your DNA and the questionnaire but I have been around a long time and have done these questionnaires many times before and guess what? I got the same results as in previous questionnaires analyzed by so called nutritionists. That is who you see when you go on Vitagene to get your results is a nutritionist. I would say their primary source of income is from the supplements they sell you based on the results of this questionnaire.

CellMaxLife,,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!,Sherri,,,4,1.0,"Wow. TOTAL waste of money. As a previous commenter noted, the health/wellness information could have come from a 7th grade Health textbook. Considering I answered a VERY long questionnaire for them AND they HAVE MY DNA, for goodness' sake, the report was extremely generic and unhelpful. Even considering all the information I gave them -- for one example, weight training 3 times a week -- my daily protein recommendation was 46 grams. I am a small female, but for anyone who knows the LEAST LITTLE BIT about nutrition, that will barely help me maintain enough muscle to get out of bed in the morning, not to mention I'm 47 yoa and we need more protein as we age for bone health. It's actually laughable if I hadn't paid them for something I didn't get. The health/wellness portion is lacking SO much, it makes me doubt that the ancestry portion is even true. If you get nothing else from this review, please heed this warning--DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY!! Just pay more money for a company like DNAfit.",2018-03-22 00:00:00

CellMaxLife,,Not an Ancestry test. Impersonal health information. Just use google and save the money.,Mike,,,2,2.0,"This isn't an ancestry test, it's an advertisement for overpriced supplements. I don't want to be overly critical here, but there is little to no information here that anyone who has ever taken a basic health class or looked into personal care wouldn't know. The actual ancestry results are remarkably vague and disappointing. The supplement/diet/exercise information is incredibly basic and impersonal. I received my kit as a Christmas gift and just received my results (that's almost two months of waiting). I feel bad that the person who purchased it for me spent money on it.

Save yourself the time and money, and go to a local GNC and talk to the hourly clerk about what lifestyle you live. They can provide you with advice on basic supplements for free.",2018-02-07 00:00:00

And I received a not so lovely call from the customer service agent, that sound like he was calling from home, he wasn't reading from a script as he was tripping all over his words, and had the nerve to question me is my sample was authentic because there was a testing error because my DNA did not match the questions on the questionnaire.

I got the results back in a little over 3 weeks or something like that - it didn’t really matter to me. I was doing this just for fun, so there wasn’t any urgency behind it haha. But for those who are doing these tests for medical/health purposes make sure you plan ahead, it take up to a month or so to get the results back. When i got the results back, I actually learned a great deal about my DNA and how I can improve my overall health. I found it interesting that I have a gene that makes me feel not as full after eating… explains why I can eat tons and tons a food. :( Anyways, the results are super helpful and I do plan on implementing some of things I’ve learned about my genetics make up into my daily practices when it comes to eating and exercise. If anything this is just good clarity on what I need in terms of eating habits and exercise. Apparently I am supposed to eat more veggies, less fatty foods… I’m also not supposed to overdose on meat haha. Not gonna happen. I am a meat eater.

Overall nicely presented and the short explanations on health results are good.",2017-08-07 00:00:00
CellMaxLife,,results are interested but not earth shattering - Would have liked the print copy but it is no longer offered,LadyA,,,8,3.0,"I am adopted and have always been curious about my ethnicity. The process was easy to follow and I received the results in less time than promised - right before my birthday, which was the goal. A large part of why I purchased this was to receive the book, which I now see is no longer offered, which is disappointing. The health results were interesting, and not as generic as some reviews lead one to believe (for example, my reports indicates that sodium does NOT spike BP as it does with many; and strength training will not build muscle as it does with some.)
I would have like greater detail on why the diet and exercise recommendations were made (why only beef listed under protein recommendations, for example) - they seemed far too tailored to my questionnaire responses than science based.

Overall I found it an adequate starting point, but in hindsight, may have chosen a different company for greater specificity.",2018-04-19 00:00:00
CellMaxLife,,Fun and worth the money for more than just heredity testing..,MB,,,23,5.0," I've seen the commercials and always wanted to do this.. heredity testing! So I finally bit the bullet. Sure enough..I'm not ""100%"" as I've been told but actually 25% an interesting mix I wouldn't have expected. But what I really like about Vitagene is that for a little more money you get so much more than just heredity testing. You complete a questionnaire in addition to the swabbing for DNA and return to Vitagene directly. You get back a detailed report on the ancestry findings, a full health report, which includes recommended diet and exercise. You also get a recommended supplement list based on your personalized results which you can order monthly directly from Vitagene. I've already order the vitamins and will give them try when they arrive. Customer support has been great as well.. when I first read my hereditary report on-line, a chat box appeared with a rep asking me if I had any questions on the findings... Very satisfied!",2017-12-04 00:00:00
CellMaxLife,,Daughter said it was the BEST GRADUATION present ever!,V. Kleinman,,,7,5.0,"I purchased 3 of these kits. One for myself and one for each of my daughters. One daughter graduated high school and the other will be a senior this year. So I bought vitagene as a fun gift for a great year they had in school.

The kits came and we decided to let my graduating daughter go first. She logged on to Vitagene entered her kit number, answered the questions, swabbed her cheeks and we placed everything back into the pre-paid box and dropped it off at the post office. The following day we did the same for my second daughter and the third day we mine. We chose to do it this way so there was not any chance of 3 excited woman accidentally mixing anything up! My husband shook his head laughing at us. *Yes, all the questions (mostly relating to your diet and exercise) need to be answered before they can give you your results all in a book form, which they send you in the mail. This is for the nutrition part. My skeptical husband wouldn't be quiet about us answering the questions and we finally told him to chill-out...followed the directions and decided to just enjoy the process and went with the flow.
We didn't buy Mr. Skeptical pants a kit yet and felt he shouldn't squash our excitement ;)

A week or so later each of us received an email letting us know they received had our kits and they would email us back with our results. Maybe 3 or 4 weeks later we were emailed a confirmation that our results were complete. We were able to download the complete report in a pdf from their website. To my complete surprise, they also sent each of us our own book with our results so I didn't have to print anything out!

So worth the money and we have had a wonderful time comparing our results and been in complete amazement how much information could be gathered from a few swabs of cheek cells!",2017-07-12 00:00:00
CellMaxLife,,Don't Buy This - Total Waste of Money,Dana S.,,,15,1.0,"Don't waste your money!!!! This DNA report is awful. It doesn't give you any real detailed information about your health or ancestry. It is very basic and vague information. I wanted to know more details for my health, diet and exercise. The DNA ancestry report is terrible too. It only gives you a region and a percentage, not the actual country that your ancestors are from. Totally worthless report.

This company is a vitamin & supplement company. They only want to sell you supplements, which I would never buy. If you want real detailed report about your health, this is not the company to use. Total waste of my hard earned money!!!",2018-01-03 00:00:00

CellMaxLife,,Very satisfied with my results!,mc734j0y,,,4,5.0,"This was my first time using an DNA kit. I was pretty sure of my ancestry, so there were no surprises there, but it was great to see it all laid out on a map with percentages. What did impress me was how easy it was to perform the test and the quick turn around of results. About a month after sending in my sample, I received an email with a link to my report. Everything was clear and easy to read. I loved the level of detail included in the health/ancestry report. The diet and exercise traits were fascinating and very helpful. What’s more is that Vitagene takes it one step further and actually offers dietary recommendations based on the questionnaire you fill out at the beginning and your genetic results. I especially like that a personalized supplement plan is included. With all the information out there these days, it’s difficult to know what supplements are right for me and which ones are overkill. Based on my genetics, Vitagene has specific recommendations for me with along with explanations for the recommendations. Overall, I am very pleased with this process and would recommend Vitagene to anyone looking for their ancestry & health information.",2018-04-17 00:00:00

CellMaxLife,,They also recommend certain supplements that you can buy from their page ...,Dewilka,,,5,4.0,"I was very excited when I first began this process. You receive your box within 2 days with Prime. Within the box are instruction on how to collect a swab sample and a pre-postaged return envelope to return it. Then the waiting begins, the process took about 4 weeks for me. I set up my online profile with my kit number on the website.
After this you can do the online lifestyle questionnaire and wait a few weeks for your results.
When I received my DNA results, I was pleasantly surprised. Some expected heritage and some not so expected.
And unlike other companies, you get so much more.
You also receive information regarding your diet and lifestyle.
If you are healthy or deficient in terms of certain vitamins, your likelihood of being successfully in certain exercise regimens.
It also informs you of your likelihood to gain or lose weight, very interesting information.
They also recommend certain supplements that you can buy from their page based on your DNA.
Overall you get a lot of information regarding you and your lifestyle all from your DNA. It was an easy process, minimal involvement. Other companies don't offer this much information and charge a much higher price. I would like to do another go at this for my mother, she' supposed to be Irish, turns out she's Italian.",2017-10-20 00:00:00
CellMaxLife,,Not worth the money.,Katelyn,,,64,1.0,"I posted a pretty lengthy review about why this test wasn't worth the money, but it got rejected. So I am going to attempt again and keep it short and simple to see if it goes through.

Ancestry was much to vague. It just told me ""European"" nothing else. Based on the website it looked like i'd get a general idea of like Irish vs Scottish, that type of break down. Not that I am basically all just European.

Also for the health aspect, all of the info they give basically comes straight from the questionnaire you fill out, so its obviously not news to you. The few tests they did as fair as certain health things I know for a fact came back because I have allergies that it said I wouldn't have",2017-06-28 00:00:00
CellMaxLife,,"Good Test, Good Company, Set Expectations Accordingly",TPW,,,2,4.0,"Couple of FYIs: 1. My purchase of two tests was over a year ago. 2. No, I'm not a fake reviewer, this is my actual experience. 3. I specifically went with Vitagene because the lab they used was considered to be first rate, and accuracy appeared more important than getting micro specific about map location (something that gets a bit more into the realm of probably, maybe)
I bought two to give one to my mother. Unfortunately she sent the test in without first registering the test kit ID. Vitagene was excellent in helping (Vitagene stated they would find the test or send another if needed. I have the emails from them to show this, despite some reviewers trying to claim good reviews are fake ).
Yes, it took multiple weeks to get back the results. If speed/quickest turn around is important to you, Vitagene may not be for you. But a quick turn around should not be what's important here IMHO.
I see reviews that criticize the report because it suggests a lactose intolerance (among others). You're not a robot, this isn't software programming within you. Vitagene testing says, in effect, you may be genetically predisposed to things such as lactose intolerance or vitamin absorption issues, for example. I took my possible genetic predispositions and used them as a way to further check if I may be actually affected by this.
Some of the, what I'll call geographical markers, that exist are not yet exact. A large geographic representation on the map for your ancestry speaks again to accuracy.

Temper your expectation on turn around time (a year ago it was taking about 5 weeks), how specific the map will be (it showed upper North Africa, it did not specify I had DNA from Casablanca), how certain genetic predispositions are (again used as information for further checking).
I didn't give it 5 stars, 4 stars I did, because I thought the push for the supplement was too strong. It felt too much salesman tactics. I'd suggest Vitagene ease up some on that. Otherwise I was very satisfied with the company and results I received (you get a book with all the results information but you can also access this online).",2018-10-15 00:00:00

About 4 weeks later the results came including DNA background and genetic health results. The results satisfied my wish to know more about my ancestry and somewhat intrigued me to learn more. Now I am going to study their recommended supplements further and possibly use it for a while and report back.,2017-04-26 00:00:00
CellMaxLife,,You're Unique - Find out Just how Unique with this DNA test from Vitagene,Steven Hirschauer,,,2,4.0," Was very interested in genetic testing. Came across this kit and it tied in with health supplements and how well exercise and diet plans would work with your gene spectrum.
The kit is simple enough to use. It arrives in the same box you will use to send your swabs to the lab with postage already assigned to it.
You do a clean swab on your left cheek, one on your right cheek, and each one has its own vial of solution that you easily snap off the swab into. You then seal up the kit and mail it in.
They were very quick to process compared to the estimated times of competitors. Even purchasing and mailing in around a holiday weekend and the midwest/Texas floods, I had my results in about a month.
The raw data was available a couple days prior to their very nice PDF format and web interactive report with graphical continent breakdowns, etc. So you can have your results further analyzed if you'd like - for specific diseases, etc.
This suggests sensititives to gluten, caffeine, weight gain, iron, vitamin A absorption on the spectrum of results in your genetic code.

Nobody in my family had done one of these before and we were all pleased to have the results.

Personally, I've been exploring lots of supplements lately and trying to have a healthier diet and fit in more exercise, so it was nice to have that eztra breakdown, plus the raw data to inquire further if I so feel the need.

I'd highly recommend the product, it weas quick and easy, and thorough. Nicely presented, and easy to do. Exactly what I was looking for and exactly what it said it would provide.

Diet- wise they asked me what I eat and what disagrees with me and they handed back what I told them and then tried to sell me vitamins. Exercise-wise they wouldn't give me any info until I told them what I enjoyed doing and then they gave me do so many minutes of that exercise per week.

CellMaxLife,,"Swab, Scrape and Send",M M,,,1,5.0,"When you receive the kit, the first thing you need to do is activate it online using a unique code posted on the kit. The code is used to keep your sample anonymous but trackable throughout the process. Next, you fill in your information on the Vitagene webpage and answer a few questions related to lifestyle. Once you've finished activating your kit and setting up your account, it's time to extract your sample, which involves scrapping the insides of both (mouth) cheeks with the provided swabs and placing them in the appropriate plastic tubes (also provided). The last step is to shake the tubes for about five seconds, place them in the collection bag, put the bag in the prepaid shipping box and then drop it off at the Post office. You can't eat, drink or smoke within 30 minutes of collecting samples. The whole process is quick and painless.

Results can take a few weeks to receive considering the amount of information being gathered. Therefore, this is somewhat of a general review as I am still in the process for receiving mine and will update after looking them over.

I had a pretty strong idea what my ethnic background was so I looked for a kit/test that did more than just tell me what I was. I wanted a kit that would also breakdown my heath habits and lifestyle and tell me if I'm making the right health choices based on my DNA. This DNA test does that and more. Not only does it tell you your complete ethnic background, but after extensive health and behavior questions, this test tells you how to use your DNA information to make better health choices. There are pages and pages (well organized) that breakdown what diets works best, what exercises, sleep cycles and what supplements that I should be using. It is one of the most comprehensive health tests I've ever received. I would highly recommend Vitagen's DNA Kit for those that are simply curious, but mostly for those that want to have a strong understanding of how their ethnicity informs important heath choices.",2017-11-02 00:00:00

I also have several problems with my health and weight, but it's been hard to identify with my doctors what the root of the issues is. I'm hoping the results of this test will give some insight into what's going on with me. The kit itself was clearly identified, the directions were simple and included diagrams, and collecting my DNA wasn't difficult.

That was the main reason I purchased this product for him he was very interested in his ancestry. aside from the ancestry report he also received a health report. The health report was a huge plus because it gave him a little more insight as to which areas of his health he can improve.

It is very easy to follow. You'll be swabbing the inside of your mouth, which is pretty quick and easy. The whole process takes less than 10 minutes. The package came with a prepaid box that you use to send in your test.
They'll provide you a booklet of your results with explanation of regions and information about your health and how to maintain it. From there, you can see what's the best food for you, how you can lose weigh, and what vitamins your body needs.
Overall, this test is amazing, I would definitely recommend it.",2017-12-01 00:00:00

CellMaxLife,,Mostly Macro level info,DMCA,,,0,3.0,"I tried out this service, it had a good price and offered me a balance of health + ancestry info. I bought two kits: one for me and one for my wife. My wife's arrived first and I must say that we were disappointed because it felt too generic. It mostly tells you regions you're originated from and the diet and exercise recommendations are also a bit macro. Nonetheless, when I received mine I was better impressed by two things:
1. How it confirmed things I knew about my ancenstry and others I only hypothesized
2. How it confirmed some suspicions I had over health lifestyle choices + results in my life.
I would give it a 3.5 out of 5 stars but Amazon doesn't let me.",2018-05-23 00:00:00

I have seen all kinds of wonderful data on salivary testing and have done it for cortisol and other hormones. I think when you buy a test you should get the results when it is done, not have to go through all kinds of nonsense and provide all kinds of info so the company and others can market you with all kinds of stuff. I am overcome by marketing via email etc I wanted info and that is all. Make it simple. In addition I mistyped one piece of info and I cannot undo or correct it with the edit function.

It also gave me health advice that was spot on! I read reviews saying that this company was just trying to sell supplements, but they have not once emailed me doing so. The report even said I was prone to high cholesterol and blood pressure which I never divulged to them.",2018-06-28 00:00:00

All you have to do is swab placed in a tube and off they went. I didn't have to pay for shipping either since there was a prepaid return label.

I got the results back in less than 2 weeks. I was surprised that not only did they provide DNA background and Ancestry reports but also a chart showing my current health. I definitely recommend purchasing this product.",2018-04-05 00:00:00

CellMaxLife,,Best DNA kit with add on insights!!,Riki,,,2,5.0,"I have been wanting to look into my DNA for months now, ever since the fad has hit the market. I thought that I would just want to know my background, but this DNA kit is much more than just finding out your genetics. This DNA kit gave me an insight of everything that I needed to know regarding my genetics and health profiles.
I had my first baby over 6 months ago and have been having a hard time losing this baby weight. It has never been an issue for me to lose weight, in fact I have been thin most of my life, so this added weight put a damper on my mood, especially when dieting and exercising was not helping. After utilizing this DNA kit, and finding out more about my body, it has helped me find out what I need to do with my diet plans to help me lose this baby weight. Since changing my dieting rituals to coincide with my genetics, it has helped me lose weight and get back into my pre-baby weight and clothes!
This kit was so easy to use. All you have to do is take the swaps, swap each check, and put the swabs into the vials given. Plus, it comes with a pre-paid box to send back to the lab.
Overall, this DNA kit has given me much more insights about my genetics than I thought it could. It is well worth the price tag, when you look into the lifelong information it gives you about your genetics.",2018-03-22 00:00:00

I have since received more information on my results which I felt was helpful. One thing that I didn't like was that I had to fill out an online questionnaire before I could get results.

CellMaxLife,,Pleasantly Surprised.,Jubee,,,10,5.0,"I just received my report with DNA results tonight. The DNA was mostly what I expected from what I know about my past ancestors with a couple lil' surprises. Therefore, I do believe the DNA is on point. Although it is a broad range, it's enough to determine your heritage areas. The health report is nicely put together and organized with nice graphics. The health report was hit or miss with me, but I can't blame that fully on the report as I have health issues that came about from non-heritage issues ~ probably environmental; i.e. autoimmune thyroid. There were things in the health report that were spot-on, like low Iron and low vitamin D which I know I have to take. Also the fact that 'too' much gluten could be an issue... I know this is probably correct as I've had intestinal issues my entire life (sorry T.M.I.). I'm still reading it, but overall I think this test is really great. One other thing I want to mention is the customer service is great. My DNA was held up in shipment by USPS and they took the time to call me and leave a message to let me know. Then they apparently went to the USPS physically to check on it and found it... and again called to let me know. Thumbs up for Vitagene. :)",2017-04-14 00:00:00

CellMaxLife,,Very Happy! Fast DNA Results + Accessible Reports + Raw DNA File.,Mr. Ortiz,,,9,5.0,"I ordered directly from the Vitagene website, but the review applies.
Speed: They were very fast. Entire time, from ordering the kit to getting results took one month. That appears to be faster than any other company.

What do you get? Well, you will no longer get a printed book. They stopped providing those for kits ordered after Aug 2017. So disregard earlier reviews touting that benefit. You do get your results online.

There is a health results section, which is based on a combination of your questionnaire answers (health goals and family history) and your DNA results. There are suggestions on what type of supplements to take, what type of exercises to focus on, etc. To me, that was the real benefit - and the reason why you'd choose Vitagene over another company. It's user friendly and easy to understand. You can order your customized supplements from Vitagene, or just order what you need from Amazon, etc.

There is also an ancestry report section, which I'd imagine most people are looking for. There is an online section with a map showing you the percentages where your ancestry originates. For example, with Africa, you'll see West Africa, North Africa, etc. For Europe, they will break it down between British Isles, Iberia, South East Europe. There is a section for Ashkenazi Diaspora. They also break down the Americas (native American) - between North / Central America, and South America / Caribbean Isles. There's a lot more, but you'll get the point. Remember, genetics predate nations... so they can give you ancestry by region, not specifically by country (Albanian vs. Macedonian, for example)

You can request your raw DNA from Vitagene. I have been able to upload the raw DNA to sites like Promethease, GEDMatch, LiveWello and get further details. These three sites can supplement what you get from Vitagene.

Overall, I'd say this was a good purchase. I felt it was money well spent. The health and supplement information was insightful, and I do feel a bit more energetic taking the suggested supplements. Using the Vitagene reports, plus taking the raw DNA files to other sites have helped me get a better insight into myself.",2017-10-21 00:00:00
CellMaxLife,,"Quick Shipping, Easy Procedure",kayla frances,,,0,5.0,"My Vitagene DNA test shipped so fast! I received it THE SAME DAY. The packaging inside was attractive and the instructions were easy to follow. Swabbing the inside of my mouth was easy, and all the steps were quick. The only ""complaint"" I have is that the instructions stated that the shipping label was included in my shipment, which led to me looking for it for like, 10 minutes, only to find it already attached to the box that needs sent back. Call it a blonde moment or whatever, but it wasn't super clear. I can't wait for my Vitagene report!",2017-05-15 00:00:00

CellMaxLife,,Don’t waste your money!,LowCarbLivin,,,3,1.0,"I didn’t purchase Vitagene through Amazon, but through their website. I was hoping to gain some insight into which health practices I can adopt to function optimally. The service is fast. I received my results in a little over 3 weeks. I was astounded and a bit confused about my ancestry results. I have always known that I am mostly European (Eastern Europe, Italy, and Scotland), but my results were different. It says that I am mostly Central European, and Eastern European. But I am also Jewish from Spain/Portugal! This was news to me and I am so excited to now further explore my Jewish ancestry. But no mention of Scotland or Italy, which I thought was odd. I just bought a more detailed test from abother company that tests both paternal, maternal and autosomal DNA with migratory patterns. The health information is garbage. They first have you fill out your profile info with your height/weight and eating/excessive habits. Part of the health report includes your BMI (which you can’t learn from DNA but rather your height/weight). It didn’t tell me if I should be on a plant based diet or meat. It told me I should consume 2000 calories a day, and 50 grams protein (I already knew this, my nutrionist calculated this form me!!). It also gave me a list of supplements that I should take AND buy from them. It told me that I don’t respond well to strength training but I should be more focused on endurance training. Health wise it doesn’t tell you much. If you want to know your BMI there is plenty of free software online to calculate it for you. Just a little bit of research will tell you how much protein and calories you should be consuming. I am giving it two stars because I was pleasently surprised to learn that I have Jewish ancestry. If you are using this for health information, don’t waste your money. You can find out all of this stuff online. And you can get a pretty good blood test called Spectracel (research it, not all doctors and labs use it but some do) that will show you all of your vitamin and nutrient levels and identify deficiencies to tell you exactly what you need to be supplementing with. If you are doing this for ancestry, choose another company with more detailed results.

I had to change this review once I got my results back from 23 and Me. It is inaccurate in terms of ancestry reports. I almost think they got my sample mixed up with someone else’s. I am taking a third test with another company to confirm. The health information they provide for you is a joke. I am supposed to have at least six glasses of water daily?? Really?? The dietary and exercise advice is very vague and calculated based on the height and weight stats you are required to enter. Save your money and try 23 and Me instead.",2017-12-30 00:00:00
CellMaxLife,,Not Much Value in “Report”,ValentineGirl,,,5,1.0,"Since I had already done a DNA analysis on a different website, I paid the 49 dollars, uploaded my raw DNA data, completed a questionnaire and waited for my results. It was easy to do and the results came back much quicker than expected (within minutes). However, I was disappointed with the “report”. It was very simplistic and I felt it was more geared toward getting me to buy their supplements. Also, their food recommendations for me consisted of about 8 foods listed under each food group—hardly a comprehensive plan. Needless to say, pretty bummed.",2018-01-16 00:00:00
CellMaxLife,,They all seemed good. I only saw a few 1-star reviews so ...,Afellma,,,2,2.0,"I bought this in January because I wanted to know about food allergies and my ancestry. I looked it up, read reviews on Amazon and the vitagene website. They all seemed good. I only saw a few 1-star reviews so I knew this was more of a gamble. I got the kit 3 days later, took the questionnaire (took about 15 minutes), swabbed my cheeks, and sent it off in the mail. I stalked fedex and saw that my sample sat in a texas fedex facility for 2 weeks which irked me.

I got the results when they said I would though, however, the results were super vague. ""You may or may not have an allergy/intolerance to gluten."" Everything was ""may be more likely to have....."" or ""may be less likely to have......."" I never got a book of my results mailed to me which I saw in many people's reviews that they did. When I downloaded the zip report, it opened up with a bunch of gibberish. Now I keep getting emails from vitagene wanting me to buy supplements.Everywhere I looked on their website and the reviews, I kept seeing ""detailed results/reports.""",2018-06-01 00:00:00
CellMaxLife,,Love the personalized touch!,Lena,,,1,5.0,"I've purchased the similar Health + Ancestry kit from 23 and Me before but felt like it didn't quite tell me much that I didn't know already or wasn't quite correct - e.g. yes, thanks for telling me I have dimples! Looking for more, I stumbled upon Vitagene and decided to opt into their most expensive and extensive of their 3 offerings (Health + Skin and Beauty + Ancestry Personal Genetic Reports)...and I think I've found a winner! If you are on the fence like I was about this kit ... here are some quick pros and cons:
Pros:
- I like that with Vitagene you don't have to generate a whole vial of your saliva, it's a simple cheek swab and you're good. So easy!
- They're really fast! If you're impatient like me, it felt like months before I got my 23 and Me results back
- You get an extensive set of actionable reports for your diet, fitness, skin and supplements that work best based on your DNA.
- Provides guidance into what you should do/what you can take so that you can improve your skin or change up your workout to suit your body type

Sort of cons
- It is definitely pricey for the ""extra features"" at $179 but to be fair, 23 and Me's Health + Ancestry kit is $199 so neither are cheap...
- Yes, they do recommend supplements which I think can be a turn off for some. However, my initial thoughts are that this may actually be helpful because I get really overwhelmed at the supplements aisle and never know what I should be taking. At least now I know what might work best with my body!
- I had never heard of Vitagene before - but I like that they're offering a bit more than just family tree info and genetic markers.",2018-07-04 00:00:00

CellMaxLife,,Didn't really tell me anything that a doctor couldn't tell ...,Kaite Pumps A lot,,,8,1.0,"Didn't really tell me anything that a doctor couldn't tell me. I found many discrepancies between just getting the 23andme & then spending $5 for promethease compared to this. Vitagene and promethease both say 2 different things, and promethease has an accumulation of all current research on most topics, including everything vitagene shares.

DO NOT SPEND this much for so little.

I honestly felt they read the questionnaire (that you HAVE to take to get results) and someone sat down and just gave me their opinion.",2017-11-22 00:00:00
CellMaxLife,,Vitagene is a complete scam!,Matthew B,,,2,1.0,"Vitagene is a complete scam! I ordered Vitagene Ancestry and Health from their website not Amazon so I will not show up as a verified purchaser this time. I was greatly disappointed by their vague pseudoscience explanations on health, exercise, etc. Nothing you do not already know. They got a number of things wrong about me even though I gave them the answers on my 100 question survey! In some cases, very bad, even dangerous health advice. The fact they do not reference specific gene markers they tested (like 23andme does) tells me they do not know what they are doing. I ordered 23andme for both the health factors and ancestry, so I know what is legit and what is scam artist. The ancestry part of Vitagene was even weird and vague with large indefinite regions. Vitagene is a supplement company, period, not based on science. I listened to Sarah, their nutritionist, who proceeded to try to sell me supplements. She admitted Vitagene is a startup company (since 2015) but claimed they website would get better. Yeah, sure. I thought I should warn others.",2018-03-14 00:00:00
CellMaxLife,,Rubbish and a waste of money (I purchased directly from Vitagene site),Michelle Onuorah,,,2,1.0,"Rubbish. I already had my DNA tested through My Heritage DNA. The only reason I spent the extra money to have it done again was because Vitagene required it for their Health Report.

The report was total rubbish. Completely vague indications with one sentence summaries of what my body may or may not be more prone to doing. I had hoped for specific food lists or exercise recommendations. Instead I got info that I could have inferred from my own preferences. I might as well have taken my $90 and thrown it in the trash. I do not recommend AT ALL.",2017-12-29 00:00:00
CellMaxLife,,It's Worth Your Life...but BE INFORMED!,Blaire,,,1,3.0,"At first, I was super disappointed in this product. The information I got was ""technically"" based off my DNA, but was extremely surface level in every way (with ancestry and health). So, I ended up taking the raw DNA file they gave me and ran it through Promethius for $10, which gave me IN DEPTH explanations as to what my DNA says. After reading my review, a guy from Vitagene gave me a call. We had an awesome and productive conversation, at the end of which, I got my money back. In that light, I decided to update my review so that you can be truly informed as you make a decision about Vitagene. Here's what you should know:

1. REACH OUT TO VITAGENE FIRST: Email them at support@vitagene.com, ask your questions and request a phone call. It's worth the hassle, believe me. Vitagene heard me when I told them how disappointed I was that I got shallow information back and explained why I used Promethius, etc. The guy I talked to (who was great) stated that they are in the process now of trying to develop what Promethius does, which is essentially give detailed explanations to customers about what their DNA says and what it means. So, before you buy, call and talk to their people. Ask them where they are in their product development and how much information you'll actually receive that's tailored to your DNA. THE INFORMATION IS WORTH IT if you can get all of it. It'll be worth the wait if you need to wait.

2. UNDERSTAND DNA + TALK WITH YOUR DOCTOR: When I checked my DNA against Promethius, I understood why Vitagene recommended the vitamins they did. Their recommendations were SPOT ON! But this was a double-edged sword. The recommendation came out of potential future/some present health risks coded in my DNA. (Almost like finding out what you might die of). It was hard to read, but super inspiring for someone who has always struggled to eat well. I found myself suddenly motivated! I looked over what Promethius wrote up, made a list of my risks, took it to my doctor and was told that 90% of everyone carries those risks in their DNA (huh...). We're all basically walking around like loaded guns and our lifestyle and diet pull the trigger. The better you understand how your body responds to those things, the better you can avoid that trigger. So, when you get the information from Vitagene, take it to your doctor. Mine looked over the list of vitamin recommendations, affirmed some and cautioned others. She also affirmed my risk list stating that if I feel weird at any given time, we can refer to it and go directly to blood tests instead of guessing for 6-12months and trying again. Super helpful! ...SO while Vitagene didn't get me all the way there, if that's where they're headed, this product is worth your life.

The reason I got Vitagene was because I wanted to understand my body better instead of mindlessly eating food and hoping that some form of exercise worked along with some vague idea of what healthy was. I want to do everything I can to not only live long, but live well, and avoid taking drugs for things that a better, DNA-tailored lifestyle can address. This is also Vitagene's goal and an honorable one at that.",2018-04-11 00:00:00
