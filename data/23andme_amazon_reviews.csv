Just be sure you want to know about your family history and exercise caution when you share results. My results had some surprises, which I was OK with. Other members of my family, not so much.

Oh, was I schocked when I got my results. At first I thought they sent me the wrong results. I am 49.7 percent European (Irish, Scottish, & UK), only 3% Native American, and 45% African American. The rest very small fractional percentages of other nationalities. It has not changed my life. I am still me! The same person I was before the results.

Told me only that I had 97 or 98% northeastern European ancestry; nothing more specific. I could have told anybody that earlier, without the DNA test, from what I know about my grandparents. A friend of mine took the DNA test from a competing company, and that company was able to nail down the specific country from which his ancestors originated. To add injury to insult, a couple of weeks after both my wife and I purchased these DNA kits, this company temporarily dropped the price of the kits by $50 each. Total disgusting waste.",2018-01-28 00:00:00

It is a risk that you may have a high chance of genetic linked problems. Think about what you will do if results are not what you want. Talk with your Doctor if you are at high risk. You may have a chance to plan ahead. They warn you ahead that some results are not what you expected. If you can Handel the truth, I say do it. It can also be a gift to science because it collects info. It is accurate. Not a joke.",2018-02-20 00:00:00
23andMe-DNA-Test-Ancestry-Personal,,Nothing but good stuff to say about 23andMe,samantha j.,,,6,5.0,"I have nothing but great stuff to say about my 23andMe. I wanted to do this test for years and finally decided it was worth the expense. Once I received the kit, I followed all of the instructions - I registered my kit, the morning before brushing my teeth I filled the tube with my saliva, closed it up according to directions and shipped it. I wasn't expecting results until mid-Feb, which gave them 8 weeks to process. They received my kit on Dec 2, I had my results by Jan 2. What a way to ring in the new year!

I spent time answering a bunch of the questionnaires they offer - all in the name of science! The more I share, I figure the more I help them discover gene expression. Some Amazon reviewers were upset that they were asked to answer these questions, but it isn't mandatory that you answer all of them.

I feel like I know SO MUCH more about myself. The way it traces back your ancestry is amazing. I have Iberian lineage?? Who knew?? I had to google Iberia! I shared my results with other users - I have 1,116 third and fourth cousins who've also done a 23andMe kit. Mind blown. I learned a lot about my wellness. I have the muscle fiber found in elite power athletes?!?!? Cool! I wish I has the joints to train like one...

I read a ton of the reviews before ordering, both on this site and the web. I feel great about my decision to use 23andMe. They really break down the science behind the test so you get a complete understanding of what you are looking at, there are tutorials on some of the items. They link to other reputable information if you want to learn more about indicators for your health. The website is super easy to navigate, and they give you plenty of information up front before you release anything, so you can make informed decisions.",2018-01-03 00:00:00

This kit made him very happy and taught him SOO much about himself! His grandmother was born in rural Mexico, she never knew how old she was or when she was born, her mother kept a log but they lost all of that information in a flood... back then, it was common for struggling parents living in rural areas, never to be issued birth certificates for their children.

My ancestry results were not what I expected so it was very interesting to learn more. My only disappointment was regarding the BRCA tests in the health portion. I was not aware ahead of time they only test for the variant common among those of Ashkenazi Jewish decent, which is rare. That was one of the main reasons I went for the health version of the test so it was disappointing that I had not found that info prior to purchasing.",2018-12-25 00:00:00

So the kits from this seller are the ones marked invalid and will not work.

If I have one complaint its that you can't download the very detailed report. It would be helpful if it could be downloaded in a word or PDF file so I could review it offline.

If you got your panties in a wad about whether it's real or whether they're feeding off your answers then, simply DON'T fill out the information about yourself until AFTER you get your results back. That's what I did and it worked beautifully. The reports are fun and informative. I've met my 1st cousin. Unfortunately, he's a total freak and I don't wanna know him but, at least I filled in an entire side of my family history because of his help. You're probably fun-loving and not nearly the hateful ogre I am so, it'll work out even better for you! I discovered through the use of this product and comparative research online that I have Aphantasia, an inability to visualize in 3D and color. I just thought I sucked as an oil painter because I was dumb! Now that I know about this genetic makeup potential, I've found others and have discovered many ways to overcoming this limitation. It's worth it but, if you need the money badly enough where you can't feed your family if you do this, then don't do it!",2018-02-24 00:00:00

It honestly took a little longer than ...,MN Reviews,,,6,5.0,"Just got my results back and it was a really cool process. It honestly took a little longer than I thought (or maybe I'm just impatient), though I sent my test back right at the end of November and it seems like the holiday season is super busy for the company. I wouldn't say that I had super mind-blowing results (it's pretty much in line with what I expected except for a curveball heritage percentage of >.01, which is basically negligible anyway), but I enjoyed reviewing my results.

I opted for the thorough test with health stuff to and some of that stuff was even cooler. All the hereditary disease stuff I tested negative for so I can't really speak to that, though I wouldn't say I feel relieved in any way b/c I wasn't familiar with most of the things they were testing for anyway. I found the behavioral results (e.g., the ones that gauge how likely you are to to fall asleep quickly or whether you toss and turn at night, etc.) to be super fascinating.

All in all, really cool to do, and I'd recommend people trying it out. I got my kit at a pretty steep discount on Black Friday and I'm not sure, given my results I'd want to pay full price. However, if you can find the test on sale, definitely go for it. You might not have these super unexpected results but it's still some pretty neat insight into what makes you tick and where you come from.",2018-01-12 00:00:00

This second point is a huge one in that it makes the other data impossible to rely upon, since if one knows that the test is providing a false negative, then it could very well be reporting false negatives and positives in other areas.",2018-04-01 00:00:00

First you are prompted to answer a bunch of questions regarding your family medical history, which I did. Then you are prompted to answer a bunch of other questions what are then ""determined"" when you get your test results. ""Surprisingly"", my DNA results indicated that I didn't have the markers for any of the diseases that I marked as negative when I filled out my questionnaire. Your ancestry will then be grouped so broadly that it won't answer any of your questions. I'm ""European""? Not a big surprise. I'm also"" British and Irish"", which they grouped together. I wanted a test that would break the results down specifically. ALSO the test results were completely OPPOSITE of the results from the National Geographic DNA test, which broke everything down. I got MUCH, MUCH, MUCH more information from the National Geographic DNA test which breaks down the routes your ancestors took then this 23 and ME test which basically parroted back the info that I answered on the initial questionnaire.

So I would recommend it as a tool to help you in your journey. My only advice, if you and siblings do this together, if your parents are living .....ask them if there is anything that may come up ..... dna doesn't lie.

23andMe-DNA-Test-Ancestry-Personal,,Disappointed with my experience!,Susan Roncevich,,,1,1.0,"I am very disappointed with 23 and Me. I have tested with other companies prior to purchasing the 23and Me DNA Test - Health + Ancestry. I had good results from the other DNA tests but I wanted to test with 23and Me for the Health reports. I purchased my kit on 11/24/17 and received the test kit on 11/29/17. The kit was received at their lab on 12/6/2017. On 2/18/18 I received an email stating ‚Äúour laboratory attempted analysis of your saliva sample but the concentration of DNA was insufficient to produce genotyping results‚Äù. They sent a replacement kit on 2/20/2018. They received my second saliva sample in their lab on 03/01/2018. I did this time reach out to their Customer Service Department a few times regarding the status of my test as I was not feeling too confident in them at this point. As suspected, I received an email on 4/2/2018 stating ‚ÄúThey could not successfully analyze the second saliva sample for the same reason that produced the first analysis failure, the concentration of DNA in the saliva sample was insufficient.‚Äù They would not send another kit but they would refund my money. My frustration with them is that I had sent a saliva sample to another company and they were able to extract my DNA with no problems. I originally never thought of the possibility that the test would fail. I was shocked. I do not recommend the 23andMe DNA Test!",2018-04-21 00:00:00

They received it and it passed quality inspection on December 9th. I patiently waited for almost eight weeks without an update from 23andMe on the status before I contacted customer service. On my first call I was informed by the representative that there was nothing that he could do until the eight weeks had past. I called back after the 8 weeks had passed and was told that they would create a ticket to have a special team that handles these type of requests investigate and provide me with an updated status. Almost another week went by without a status update so I called customer service again. I am currently on hold and have been for the past 25 minutes waiting to speak to a supervisor.

It doesn't matter how good their product is. Their customer service is awful and this is no way to run a company!

23andMe-DNA-Test-Ancestry-Personal,,Communications Issue/ Careful With Box Opening,katanaguy,,,10,2.0,"This is sort of a pre--review....I will explain why. I had received my package and so far have 2 areas that I must say 23andMe needs to change ASAP 1) Directions say it normally takes 2 to 5 minutes to spit into the accompaning tube the amount of saliva needed to test, well it was taking me a longggg time and was going to ask if I could sit tube down for a while and come back a little later when my mouth saliva would ""reactivate"" as I call it to do this..... so I called their customer service # for suggestions and an answer. 2) their ""phone reps"" are very, very hard to understand--the 2 diff reps I had anyway were foreigners and I struggled to get understanding to simple questions I had. On my 1st call to them it was so bad I politely asked for someone who spoke better English and the rep hung up on me.....so I called back....2nd guy was just a little better...not much.....AND they try to TALK OVER YOU...they need to slow down and LISTEN TO THE CALLER...... and I could tell they are reading FROM SCRIPTS IN FRONT OF THEM. I have no doubt they DO NOT work only for taking 23and Me calls, but prob are phone reps for many other even totally unrelated co's as well. That is the way it is done now- when these reps take a call and then find out what product you are calling about, they just quickly pull up on their screens that particular phone script for that product from the co you are calling about. I do want to say I do not have any grudge against any foreign person it is just frustrating that 23and Me cannot give us better English speaking people....I sure hope it is not the same if I call back in future for further questions about results once completed. So, I finally got the sample just now mailed back to them and will await the results....One......OTHER VERY IMPORTANT NOTE HERE...When you receive the smallish box in mail, DO NOT just rip it open...be very careful opening because it is the same box you will use to send in your saliva sample- the pre-paid postage paid label is on back of that box....so BE CAREFUL WITH IT. Hope my early comments will help some of you-- it is not an overall review of their service of testing and receiving results. I will post another review once all is completed.",2017-12-02 00:00:00

But a lot is outright wrong. What is correct is utterly useless information that I ALREADY KNEW ABOUT MYSELF because a MIRROR was invented for some time now. The ""health"" information is just stupid and most of it is information about health in general that they use to fluff up and pad their report to justify your cost. Want to know how trivial and useless? Here are some of my results all bunched together:

Asparagus Odor Detection-->Likely can smell(WTF?); Bald Spot-->Likely no bald spot(Wrong!Unfortunately); Earlobe Type-->Likely detached earlobes(Correct!And I really hate it when I lose one of my detached earlobes.I look funny all day.); Early Hair Loss-->Likely no hair loss(Wrong!Again!Just started Minoxidil;Crossing fingers); Earwax Type-->Likely wet earwax(I guess so.Can't compare to what dry is and don't want to find out); Eye Color-->Likely brown or hazel eyes(Correct!); Finger Length Ratio-->Likely ring finger longer(Wrong!It's my middle finger.Which is currently raised high at 23andMe for fooling me into paying this much money for useless info.); Freckles-->Likely little freckling(Correct!); Hair Texture-->Likely straight or wavy(Correct!Hmmm... straight or wavy? That's kind of hedging a little and covering all the bases there.Oh, right, forgot there's curly too.My bad.); Back Hair-->Likely little upper back hair(Correct!); Bitter Taste-->Likely can taste(Correct!); Cheek Dimples-->Likely no dimples(Correct!); Cleft Chin-->Likely no cleft chin(Correct!); Light or Dark Hair-->Likely dark(Correct!Truly Impressive.Getting the correct answer on 50/50 odds ... 23andMe would make a killing in Las Vegas, baby!); Newborn Hair-->Likely lots of baby hair(Correct!My mom called me 'Her Little Sasquatch. Just kidding.); Photic Sneeze Reflex-->Likely photic sneeze reflex(WTF?Never happened before.But I do sneeze like hell on the disco dance floor!); Red Hair-->Likely no red hair(Correct!); Skin Pigmentation-->Likely lighter skin(Correct!);Sweet vs. Salty-->Likely prefers salty(It's a coin toss here.I'm chubby and have high blood pressure.); Toe Length Ratio-->Likely second toe longer(Correct!So that's why I stub that toe all the time.It's my genetics!); Unibrow-->Likely at least a little unibrow(Yeah, okay, okay, you got me. My secret's out. So I pluck my eyebrows a little. Manscaping is not a bad thing); Widow's Peak-->Likely no widow's peak(Correct!)

The one star is for the only thing I found interesting which is the heritage section. Most I already knew but some of the details I didn't know. I thought I was Chinese, Japanese, Portuguese, and Hawaiian. Now I know not only am I Chinese, Japanese, Iberian(Portuguese), Oceanian (Hawaiian), but also South East Asian (Filipino), Korean, Mongolian, and Finnish!

There should also be info on said countries, or even the general areas which is what 23andme loves, and that is the GENERAL and vague.

23andMe-DNA-Test-Ancestry-Personal,,So much good information about me.,"Tech reviews from the bathroom<span class=""a-profile-verified-badge""><span class=""a-profile-verified-text""></span></span>",,,39,5.0,"  I always Identified myself as a African American, but never knew where I fitted in. I have a olive brown skin tone and light brownish, greenish eyes. I was super excited when I had the chance to do this 23 and me DNA test.I now had a chance to learn about me through genes and with DNA. Here is how it works, open up the package, take out the tube, the instructions are straight froward just remember not to eat or drink 30 minutes before you take the test. 23 and me did a great job explaining the use on the box. Back to the process, fill the tube up to the line with your saliva, press down on the cap firmly. The first cap on the tube is filled with liquid, that is released upon pressing down, this mixes with your saliva, shake, place new cap on tube, seal in bag, place in box and send it off. Pretty simple, it wasn't hard at all but you have to send it by FedEx. After three weeks or so I got my email, stating my DNA results were in. What I discovery shock me! According to the DNA test I wasn't 100% African, I was 78% African, 16.5 European and bunch of other stuff. I spent days reading it over and over again. The best part is the relatives feature, this allows you to find other people who share your genetic traits, Second cousin and thirds cousin all can be found there. The Kit is well worth the money, even if you already heritage, it also offers a wellness report. This report shows if you are a carry of certain diseases. The report study your genes and point out if you are lactose intolerant, if you sleep well, muscles type and much more. This alone is worth the money, very important if you plan on having kids,or dealing with a mystery illness, it could help answer questions. Five stars all the way a must have.",2016-10-26 00:00:00

When I got my results back there is no medical history and they said that I did not pay for this. But they are happy to give me the results if I pay $120 more...

I also do not trust my results at all. There results that are coming up are showing me only one last name ( out of 977 results) that is familiar on my list of relatives. It‚Äôs Clark. It doesn‚Äôt show that I have any Native American or Scottish ancestry even though my mom is atleast 80% Scottish.

It took three weeks to get the test back (end of June) when I was expecting it in August. I called the help line and it goes straight to a man in India that barely could understand me and said there is no way any mistakes could be made. He yelled this at me after I questioned him.

I mostly took this test to get the health results. I know my family and I know up to third cousins on almost all the branches. I‚Äôm German Scottish English and Irish With a pinch of Native American.

23andMe-DNA-Test-Ancestry-Personal,,*UPDATE - better service than I had imagined,Scott Zimmerman,,,7,4.0,"I realize that my main beef with this kit was actually 'our' fault, but my wife went through the instructions, spit in the tubes, boxed them up and then sent them off - before realizing that the only way to connect her sample with her online account was a number that was on the tube itself. The number is not printed/posted anywhere else, and if you didn't create your account and register your number BEFORE you send off the sample, you just flushed $150 down the drain. There is no way for them to link that sample to my wife any more.

Apparently this is a very common issue, as on their website they listed it specifically on their Accounts and Registration FAQ (""What should I do if I sent my sample to the lab before registering it?), yet they still can't be bothered to put the bar-code on anything you aren't sending back to them.

This is NOT a problem if you order directly from the company, because then they have an email address they can contact you at but when purchased through a third party like Amazon you are simply SOL.

*UPDATE - after contacting 23andMe directly via their website and explaining my problem/frustration, they were able to furnish me a brand new kit at no addition cost to ourselves so long as I could prove my original Amazon purchase (which I did). Thus, while my overall complain still stands that they should close the loop on this very obvious and frequent issue of people sending in the kits without registering them first at least they made good on our mistake and we're eagerly awaiting the results of the new, registered kit.",2017-12-19 00:00:00

Also found it interesting to have the generation timeline included of various countries where my ancestors were from.

23andMe-DNA-Test-Ancestry-Personal,,Fun Overall,CH,,,10,4.0,"TIME:
-Took me 4 weeks to get my results. From what I read online, this varies greatly from person-to-person. You can check the status online after you register your kit. The DNA extracting step took the longest (about 2.5 weeks). Most other steps took about 2-3 days.

ANCESTRY RESULTS:
-I found out I was European, as I expected! It does not give you very detailed countries, but it does provide you with countries that are included in the given groupings. This makes sense because its hard to separate countries from each other when they are so close. I used the information, along with what I knew about my family history, to interpret what the countries in the grouping are likely to be.
- I also thought it was neat they test for neanderthal genetics, which I supposedly have! 23 and me said I have more genetics than over 51% of people who've done 23 and me. Don't know what that means really, but it is cool!

HEALTH RESULTS:
-I only had a ""slight risk"" for one and no variants detected for another, which was nice to see. I ended up paying 5$ for Promethease as well, which told me I also had a slight elevated risk for the same thing as 23 and me. It did, however, note that I may have some variants that 23 and me said I did not have, which left me a bit confused. Promethease is WAY more information (and health variants it looks at) and it is much harder to read, so I liked having both to compare.

OVERALL:
-Overall, I thought it was fun. I got this for a Prime Day deal so it was 1/2 off. Don't know if I'd pay full price for it, but for the deal I got, I thought it was fun and good overall! Just know you'll have to interpret your results with family history you know, in order to get more specific results. For me, it just validated what I already knew. Definitely something worth trying, especially if its on a sale.",2017-08-20 00:00:00

So I was waiting and waiting for some sort of sale, and I was thrilled to come across this at a discount on Amazon Day. The collection process was very easy -- just spit into a tube, follow their directions to shake it up and cap it off, and use their prepaid mailer to drop it into the mail. Unfortunately, after waiting 4-6 weeks for results, I got an email saying there wasn't enough DNA in my sample to run the test. That's rare, but it can happen. If it does, they send you a new collection kit and run it again at no charge. If they can't perform the test on that second try (even more rare, but that can happen too), they refund your money. I did some internet research before the second try, and this time I chewed and chewed on the inside of my cheek to try to slough off enough cells to provide the DNA. Was nervous during the wait for results, but the second time worked like a charm! I was grateful to 23andMe for providing such good service in terms of the re-test.

As for results, my nationality report was not interesting in any way, but I didn't really expect that. I'm 99.9% northern european, which came out as 50% ""generic European"" and smaller percentages that could be matched to specific countries. The specific countries matched exactly with what I would have expected based on my grandparents' heritage. The website lists registered users with related genetics (you can choose whether or not to appear in those listings), and there was nothing terribly exciting, but there was a 2nd cousin whose family names included my grandmother's (very unusual) maiden name, so that was kind of cool. I really signed up largely for the raw data to use in analyzing my health reports. The actual 23andMe genetic health report was fairly skimpy compared to the number of potential mutations out there, but they did correctly identify one significant mutation (Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency) that I already knew results for from a past genetic test. Haven't explored the condition information available on the 23andMe website, but I know that there is some. I've been using a 3rd party site (Livewello, paid but relatively inexpensive) where you upload your raw data from 23andMe and then can find out results for 1,000+ specific bits of genetic material.

There are dozens of programs out there that can use 23andMe data to tell you fascinating and useful things about yourself.

It took the Human Genome Project $2.7 billion and 18 years to sequence the first human genome.

The upgraded reports told me such amazing things like I probably don't have a widows peak in my hair and my ear lobes might be detached. The health recommendations were earthshattering insights like ""avoid fast food"" and ""exercise.""

The extra reports were immediately sent after my payment; no extra work needed to be done. I excitedly dug into the new info and, after being disappointed, filled out an online form to request a refund an hour after my purchase.

I got an email response saying they couldn't take back my access to the new reports on their website so they wouldn't be able to issue a refund because they started what reports were included. They did not say how useless the info was in those reports though.

If you are considering purchasing, just get the ancestry reports and save your money from the other reports.

(luckily, I am negative for all that worried me) I do like that in the results I can select and compare selected people with others linked to my DNA which helped me to determine which ancestral line they come from. I also found it fascinating that it linked me to others who are descendants of the Mayflower but cousins removed many times over. Having researched my ancestral history already gave me an advantage in that I recognized some of the last names of people in the results with whom I am related to from many generations ago!

Round off errors could account for about 0.3% of ""other."" The only thing that surprised me was there wasn't any ""Native American"" at all with either report. I've always been told that a great-grandmother was Native American. Need to dig into that some more.

Some of the more medical related reports were a mix. Said I shouldn't have a ""widow's peak"" but I've always had one. Said I would have a tendency to go bald but I'm well past 65 and have plenty of hair. (My Dad and maternal grandfather were bald.)

It took less than four weeks to get the results once I mailed in the kit. I didn't have any problems getting my reports or anything like that once I got the email that the analysis was complete. Interesting results but not really sure what to do with it now that I have it.",2017-09-11 00:00:00

The rest of it is just nonsense. I ""may or may not be likely"" about 1000 other things which seemed to be wrong most of the time. They really can tell you nothing else. Frankly, the uselessness and vagueness of the rest of these things makes me question the accuracy of their ancestor location data. You will get no useful information from any of it.

I'll admit, I was hesitant to purchase this item considering the multitude of bad reviews. However, I'm adopted, and the idea of trying to get some semblance of my origins, and whether or not there are any variants in my DNA that could result in cancer, Alzheimer's, etc, has been burning my brain for years. I already knew that I'm part South Korean, but the DNA test elaborated further on unknown factors. It included a mapping of all other areas of my ancestry, such as being British and Irish, as well as having other EuroAsian ancestry. It relieved my fears of possibly getting cancer or Alzheimer's via genetics. So, all in all, it gave me the pertinent information I was curious about.

The Cons

Yes... it does take an excruciatingly long time to receive your results. My saliva sat in some warehouse for three weeks before being processed; which took another three weeks. The results do send back a lot of extraneous information (trait reports) that may or may not be relevant. For example, mine said that I don't have dimples. I have one. I also apparently have very little freckles... Really? Because I can literally map out constellations on my freckly face. I have misophonia.. Wait... what? I don't like chewing sounds?! That's just bizarre, because I don't know how you can come to that conclusion based on my saliva sample. At any rate, there are some quirks to this test, but for people curious about knowing their roots, it really isn't that bad of a product. It's nothing Earth shattering or shocking when you get your results back, but as of yet, I have no regrets purchasing this product.",2018-09-07 00:00:00

We opened our boxes and followed the instructions to register our individual kits online in our names then followed the steps of how to provide the saliva sample (super easy) and then sealed the packages back up and put in the mailbox to get sent off. My results came back very quickly 4 weeks while my husbands took the few more weeks. The website is easy to follow and they make your results easy to read. We love that there are so many tests and features covered and easy to chose how to share your information and with whom. Since receiving our results over 6 months ago we have bought 2 more kits to start getting grandparents done and they have enjoyed completing and receiving the information as well. The best part is they continue to use your sample for new health and genetic tests/reports so every few months we get an alert that new reports are available. It really is the gift that keeps on giving since we continue to get new reports on new traits and health risks , but we have been able to share our reports with grandparents now and learn information about our family and our selves. We have even started some contact with possible distant cousins.

Now here is where it gets a bit crappy. 23andme outsources the testing to LabCorp (for multiple and legit reasons that is actually beneficial to you the customer) though they had some security issues that required some down time which meant some holdups on processing, some redirecting of packages to another lab, etc... though they are horrible about communicating these delays and just give you cookie cutter responses instead of an honest explanation as to what is going on. If you ever need to call them you get outsourced call service which I honestly did not even waste my time with and automatically asked for someone in the states. Luckily my sample only ran in to two delays, both of which were fixed within about a week each so not as horrible as some other people. Do expect this to take the full 6-8 weeks they ask for though you might get lucky and get it in 4. They do seem to have resolved their issues though and are catching back up so this may no longer be an issue. Do I still recommend this? Yes if you have patience and time to let the sample run its course how ever long it takes. The results are awesome.

23andMe-DNA-Test-Ancestry-Personal,,privacy issues,C.E.L.,,,4,3.0,"Got the kit. Everything well set up and easy to do. HOWEVER! When I went to register the kit I found extensive tracking and sharing of personal data. I am not referring to the medical data. I presume that's fairly safe but the tracking devices to be installed on my computer for advertisers and general information collection about my personal interests and habits I found to be horrific. I am NOT a whiz with computers so that makes me all the more uneasy. We have ample evidence of how language is 'spun' to make things seem innocuous when they are in fact invasive. If this doesn't bother you, then the process should be fine. But it does bother me and now I am out all that money because I prefer my privacy.

One more thing I would like to add. The site could have provided an option to opt out of various sharing and tracking of my activities. Instead it included information of how I could go to different browser settings and delete cookies and subroutines they inserted into my computer. This sounds good EXCEPT two 'details'. Not only does it (1) put the burden on YOU to adjust settings (multiple steps) for each browser (I have Explorer, Chrome Google and Bing) but a further later disclaimer said that (2) (if I understood it correctly) indicated that every time I went to their web site, I automatically left permission for them to reinsert all over again and I would have to repeat the whole process again to retain my privacy. This is marketing and advertising information and general data collection and these routines are inserted into my computer so they don't end when I leave their website (they said so).",2018-08-15 00:00:00

Only the weatherman can have such little accuracy and still have a job. Same thing on my wife's report. Ambiguous reports about being Northern Western European. Apparently French and German are the same thing, not a very satisfying result.

The health and genetic traits are interesting but still not quite scientific break through. I am glad I don't have to worry about Parkinson's or Alzheimer's but I already have a lactose intolerant test, drink a glass of milk and walk around with a stomach ache.

The process was quite simple and everything was included. Simply spit into a little cup, toss the pre-paid box into the mail and wait. The waiting period is the hard part as it does take several weeks but well worth it when you receive the results.

Personally, the ancestry portion is interesting but not overly valuable. I verified the origin countries I've been told since childhood were pretty much right with no major surprises but that's about it.

The company, customer service, product, and accessibility to the research and data are impeccable! I have DNA kits from both ancestry.com and 23andme.

23andMe-DNA-Test-Ancestry-Personal,,Sharing profiles horribly broken. Forced to share all information or none.,abc,,,5,1.0,"Somehow this site is still broken even after I brought it to 23andMe's attention 8 months ago. With the heightened attention to people having control over their private data, you'd think 23andMe would wake up and fix things, but alas, they continue their amateur ways. I currently manage 3 different profiles, my own plus one for each of my parents. All 3 profiles are under one account for simplicity and because I actually thought 23andMe knew what they were doing and thought things through. However, I was completely wrong. As it stands, there is no way to have separate sharing settings for each profile. If I share my information with one person, they get access to all three profiles. If I remove a connection from a profile, it gets removed from all three profiles. Seems pretty asinine to me and means there isn't really 3 separate profiles, but 1 single profile with the DNA information of 3 individuals. Just because I want to share my own information with a friend doesn't mean I would want to share my parents' information nor would they want me to share that information. However, that is my only option. It's completely befuddling as to who would ignorantly think this is how it should be, but apparently someone thought it was. This is quite indicative of the disconnect between 23andMe, its clientele, and the intended usage of their site. Until they fix this patently absurd oversight, I would steer clear of 23andMe. They need to get their act together first. Been around for years and can't get the basics correct? Seriously? Go with AncestryDNA.

they have updated it since she initially got her results back and they have changed. she also has new health updates. my whole family wants to get one so we can all do it so our results are more accurate. if my parents both did it and we connected the accounts (which you CAN) then you will get the most accurate results as you have your parent's DNA.

Followed the kits on USPS tracking. Both kits arrived at USPS' Los Angeles transfer station later that week, but every day it said 'delivery delayed'. On Jan 11 emailed 23andMe asking if this kind of delay was normal. Received a response same day saying that this was normal, that USPS handles 23andMe packages differently than other kinds of mail and that samples mailed from within the United States typically reach the lab within 2-4 weeks, that we'd receive an email when their lab scans our kit bar code, and to request another kit if we didn't hear from them in 4 weeks. Didn't make sense that it would take 2-4 weeks to deliver the parcel to 23andMe when it had safely arrived in L.A. within a few days, so looked for other feedback sites.

For that I had to download my genome file and upload it to genetic genie and then research each variation. I bought this kit on Amazon Prime day, so for half the regular price I'm thrilled with the value. I couldn't get myself to pay the full price though, and I hope in the future they make the cost a little more accessible to everyone.

23andMe-DNA-Test-Ancestry-Personal,,Great for finding DNA relatives; Health & Ancestry location reports have a long way to go,RC,,,2,4.0,"I am leaving this review so people know what to expect from this test. It is great if you are trying to identify your birth relatives or find missing relatives. Unfortunately, they just deleted all anonymous relatives from your report, so that makes it a little more difficult - you can't even contact them anonymously anymore to see if they might help you. We did find a lot of relatives on my mom's side though who could help us identify her father after a lot of work. With more and more people taking the test, this will get easier as the database grows. Here is my experience with ancestry locations. My mom and I both took the test and are in the database. When I got my own results, they were about what I expected since I had been researching the family history for years. They did not show any Native American ancestry though. Once I linked my record to my mom's, the ancestry changed, skewed a little more towards my mom's side. My dad didn't want to test. Since I am mostly European, I took a much more expensive and comprehensive European test at DNA consultants. They use Codis, the same database the FBI uses. I got a much more comprehensive breakdown of my European ancestry and my native American ancestry showed up on their test. Now none of these tests is perfect. They pick up deep ancestry, and they get better over the years as more people join the database. If you have a lot of UK ancestry like I do, they may identify you as part Scandanavian due to the Viking invasions. Since populations have become increasing mobile, and races mixed, I can't see how these can ever be completely accurate unless you also have a lot of ancient DNA in your database. They do have some. They can tell you how much Neanderthal dna you have for example, which is fun to know, though not really useful. Just take it all with a grain of salt. Also it is possible to be descended from some races and not have enough dna for them to show up on the test. As for the health reports: they test for some variants of some diseases. But not all variants of those same diseases. So the info is useful to have, but very incomplete. It is useful for you and your doctor to know if you have markers from both parents for a particular disease, but often all you can do to help prevent getting these diseases is to have your doctor watch for them, then eat right and exercize. Which you should be doing anyway to help prevent any disease. Some of the minor things on my report such as likelihood of flushing or having freckles were dead wrong. Maybe i had those genes, but they weren't very active in me or something. Hair, eye and skin color were correct for both of us. Again, for some of these things, they rely on questionnaires which most of the test takers don't even answer. Then if you have the same marker as some people who say they flush easily, then they say you are likely to flush easily. Maybe these parts of the report will become more accurate with more people in the database. But it relies too much on people bothering to answer questions about themselves and answering honestly. To sum up: There are better tests out there for health markers and ancestry composition. It is fine for locating DNA relatives. If you want to locate more DNA relatives, you have to take the test with all the major companies or upload your info. Also, they trashed the family tree portion of this database. When I first joined, I entered all my family tree. Then they made me upload it to myheritage.com. Then they disconnected from myheritage.com so that was all a waste of time. Now it looks like they may be reconnecting again. Anyway, if you want your dna linked to your family trees - just go directly with ancestry.com and skip this company.",2018-09-19 00:00:00

My friend and her brother both did it and it matched them as siblings, so if you were ever doubting that they actually map your DNA, there is a little proof.

For the health and trait piece, I feel it was not really worth it. The results were very back and forth. I received a lot of conflicting results like ""you're at a high risk for XYZ"" and then another area would say ""you're at a low risk for XYZ."" HUH? There were also a lot of things that came up that have NEVER been in my family health history.

23andMe-DNA-Test-Ancestry-Personal,,The missing pieces...,Karyl,,,2,4.0,"Although I love my adopted family dearly, as an adoptee there have always been huge chunks of the puzzle that is 'me' missing and living in a still closed adoption state I spent most of my life wondering about my biological side and envying those who could say for sure they were X,Y,Z. In my late 50s now and having run this concept past my now in his 90s adopted dad and hearing he's very okay with it (and with this having gone on sale :-D ) I finally decided to 'go for it' and can now say that having this done was one of my better decisions. It has helped me fill in those gaps a bit (and has even very cautiously started me on a journey that may help me know a bit more of my biological family's story and sooth a lifetime of yearning to know).

It was interesting to learn that although I'm heavily Caucasian I also have Hispanic and somewhere in the past few hundred years one of my ancestors was a POC from Africa.

The Neanderthal info was fun and researching more about how this now extinct branch lived and possibly helped Homo sapiens is pretty fascinating but I'm a bit of an info junkie. :-D

As for the company and kit itself... The kit was well packaged and the instructions easy to follow. It took less time to process than they said but it still 'feels' like a long time when you're waiting excitedly. I find the 23andMe website fairly easy to navigate and informative but would like to see more 'bang for the buck' or a lot less 'buck' as a regular price. If I had paid full price instead of half I'd have been much more disappointed.

Overall I'd recommend the company and having the test done. FWIW, If you're a fellow adoptee or birth family member of one interested in connecting, I highly recommend using BOTH this 'and' Ancestry, downloading your 'raw data' and uploading it to a few of other DNA family tree sites (who are free or very inexpensive for uploading raw data to) to find the most possibilities. :-)",2017-09-15 00:00:00

I purchased the Ancestry.com test years ago and found out after taking the 23 and Me test that you receive much more value with the Ancestry.com test. I ran the Ancestry.com results through a free online algorithm that gave me the health risks. The free website offered the same and substantially more information than the 23 and Me report. I ordered the 23 and Me test specifically for the health risks profile. It is totally worthless for the majority of customers.

Very disappointed and would very much appreciate my money back if possible. The only thing this DNA test did was reaffirm that I am European. Nothing medical at all to help me. It tells you non-meaningful traits like if your earlobes are detached, or if you're likely lactose intolerant, which I am, though it says I likely am not- so it's also inaccurate. Things that don't help you understand yourself at all. Why do I care if my earlobes are detached or what type of earwax I have? Yes, this is what you're paying for, to know if you have wet or dry earwax, or if you have a widows peak, things you either don't care about or already know. Would not recommend this at all. As a psychologist, I am considering actual genetic testing by a licensed doctor in my local area to find the results I need, because I am assuming all these at-home DNA kits are the same. They appeal to the novelty, without any of the science. Also looking at Genomind and Genecept Assay because those will tell psychiatrically what medications may be best for mental illness, and I am curious to know if my current mood stabilizer is recommended for me based on my genetic makeup.

23andMe-DNA-Test-Ancestry-Personal,,"Well, thats not at all what I expected.....",HeyLei,,,2,5.0,"My husband recently took this test (because he is adopted) and we wanted to find out more about his ancestry. We found out a pretty detailed break up of his ancestry. Nothing too out of the ordinary of what we already assumed, he's white (mostly Northern European -- Irish British) and is related to some Midieval king. So when the tests were on sale during Amazon Prime Day my husband got one for me to do just for fun. I've basically grown up with the knowledge that I am Filipino (my mom), Spanish, and French (Dad). I wasn't expecting to learn much. Well, I got my results yesterday and within a matter of hours my world was turned upside down. My results were much more complex then I ever could have imagined: East Asian, Native American, Iberian, Italian, African, Ashkenazi Jew, Northern and Southern European, Indian. And then everything else listed after was less than 2% (Oceanic, Middle Eastern, Unassigned, etc) . No French and my mom is obviously not 100% Filipino. I mustered up the strength to share my results with my dad, and he immediately flipped out telling me that the tests were either wrong or my mom basically cheated on him and I'm not his daughter......WTF. My dad was mostly joking, I think. I feel like everything I have ever known has been a lie. Who am I? I have been filling out all my forms out incorrectly...all my life. I'm Italian, which now explains my love for pasta and family loyalty. This is all so much for me to take in. My anxiety is beginning to kick in. Be aware that 23 and Me does warn about the possibility of experiencing ""emotional difficulty"" with regards to learning your results. That's an extreme understatement. Make sure sure you have a good support system in place to help you deal with any surprises that could possibly arise.

Ok, maybe I'm exaggerating this experience slightly, but my dad did say that I'm most likely not his. That part's true. But how cool is it to find out all this new stuff about who I am? I feel like I'm that much closer to gaining a grasp on my true identity. I totally recommend doing this test, what a fun experience.",2017-08-12 00:00:00

Save your money, and wait until you do just the autosomal test, then upload your raw DNA data to promethease.com or you could get VitaGene.

When you change results to the 90% conservative interpretation, your ancestry results change to much less definitive numbers. $199 to find out you are ""broadly"" from one area?

If it's okay for you to pay $130 and get something after 3 months then go for it (could take more than 3 months, who knows). Oh yeah and there are possibilities that your saliva couldn't be analyzed due to ""insufficient amount of data"" which they never will tell you before purchasing.

23andMe-DNA-Test-Ancestry-Personal,,"Zero star, waste of money, so disappointing.",BJMC,,,59,1.0,"Zero stars. What a waste of money. It told me I was of 100% European background which I already knew, I understood this DNA test would break it down a little more specific, and now it tells me it can't complete my origins without my father or brother's DNA so I would need to buy a whole other kit. I was so excited to get the results only to be so disappointed when they came, it took me about 10 minutes to read all of the details in my report. The result was as follows: (European 100.0%), Northwestern European 95.6%, British & Irish 36.5%, Scandinavian 13.1%, French & German 11.5%, Broadly Northwestern European 34.5%, Southern European 1.4%, Balkan 1.2%, Broadly Southern European 0.2%, Eastern European 1.3% Broadly European 1.6%. It doesn't even break it down to which side my Mom or Dad's it comes from without their DNA. SO not worth it. It reads: To see how much of your ancestry composition was inherited from each of your parents, you must be connected to at least one parent. This simply means one of them must take the DNA test to obtain the results. It states: Paternal haplogroups are families of Y chromosomes that all trace back to a single mutation at a specific place and time. By looking at the geographic distribution of these related lineages, we learn how our ancient male ancestors migrated throughout the world. Share with your brother or father. When this feature is available, you'll receive your paternal haplogroup assignment. It gave me the female side because I'm female.

I would not recommend this product. They want you fill out survey upon survey and even when you do they get the information in the DNA kit wrong or opposite of what you willingly tell them.

This DNA test said that she was 84% sub-Saharan African. Wow, ya think? 14% northern European. Gee what a shocker.

We had this fantasy that we'd be told where in Africa, and where in Europe. As it stands, this was $200 of stuff that was obvious.

Quite a number of the physical traits came back similar to the following: 60% chance of no freckles, 40% freckles (actually, freckles). But the percentages are so close it could go either way. Mostly, they erred on the wrong side ... but at 60-40, you aren't getting any real information.

Similarly, you're told your chances of having brown eyes, brown skin, detatched earlobes .... wow it's like we don't need mirrors anymore.

23andMe-DNA-Test-Ancestry-Personal,,Accurate! It's a girl....,Elizabeth,,,1,4.0,"5 stars based on gender accuracy. It's a girl! And sure enough my genetic blood testing confirmed.

4 stars for the blood collection process.

Improvements would include instructions outside of the box so you can read what the process entails prior to collection. Even if they are printed on the box still sealed.

My biggest issue was the collection vial didn't have a distinct edge/lip where u can scrape the blood off your finger. Mine took 3 pricks before I got good blood flow and by then it was sticky and clotting. I couldn't scrape the blood into the vial bc there was was a thin blood bubble blocking it and blood was running everywhere but into the collection vial. It was a total mess bc of this. However, maybe had I done the prick on the outside of my ring finger first it would have gone a lot smoother and avoiding this issue entirely.

Overall, I would purchase again since the results were accurate in my case.

Tip: With my experience my ring finger, on the side by my pinky in the fatty part, was the best place to prick.

Good Luck.",2018-04-19 00:00:00

23andMe-DNA-Test-Ancestry-Personal,,Inferior Product Costs Twice the Price,Gothson,,,36,1.0,"After their fallout with the FDA, 23andMe now put out a poor product that costs twice as much as the other two major DNA testing services, the other testing companies being AncestryDna and FamilyTreeDna. It doesn't have much to offer. They used to give a lot of information about medical conditions that one might develop, but after the FDA stopped them from giving medical advice, they have basically come up with a watered down product. I mean, who cares if they tell me I can smell asparagus in my pee or if I have light-colored eyes? I don't need a DNA test for that. I already know that. Tell me something I don't know!

Then regarding the ability to discover extended family members via DNA matches and to confirm various branches in one's family tree, 23andme fails miserably. Privacy settings are the default which results in most people not sharing any family names or trees, and sometimes they are completely anonymous that you don't even know the name of the person you are matching, so you are left in the dark. Gee, your closest match is ""anonymous"". I take that as a giant middle-finger.

It seems they don't really care anymore. They wanted to get a big enough database so that they could sell the data to big pharmaceutical companies, and maybe now they have got what they needed. Well, I would not recommend this company to anyone. Save your money and test yourself at Ancestry or FamilyTreeDna instead.",2016-09-04 00:00:00

23andMe-DNA-Test-Ancestry-Personal,,"Lost money, unable to register kit, worthless customer service",Emendator,,,27,1.0,"I mean go ahead if you don't believe me, waste your money. These people claim to give you information although if you read their Facebook page, you will learn (in a hard-to-find left sidebar) that many people have communicated the problems they've had.

In my case, I carefully and properly registered the product on their website and received the confirmation email, only to have an email forwarded to me that said the test kit had been received back by 23andme but that there was no corresponding registration. So I went through that process again, again receiving the email that is sent to confirm the registration. Yet again they said there was no registration. I have communicated with them through their customer service email link to no avail. The 23andme customer service people keep emailing that it is customer error when in fact their system is broken. This means that about $110 is lost because there is no way to connect the test kit with me.

Not only are they too arrogant to look for their system failure, they have set up contact by email only. You cannot communicate with these isolated ivory tower people by telephone.

If you've followed the trouble 23andme has had with US FDA, you know that these people were cocky enough to fail to reply timely to the FDA's demands; thus the FDA forced them to stop giving customers ""health-related"" information. That, of course, was one of the reasons customers wanted their DNA tested.

My brother initially paid them $200 for a test and then 23andme came up with a way to extort $200 more out of him if he wanted further results. Just thought you'd like to know this.

Update: The third time I attempted to register this kit it worked and was an entirely different experience although I did exactly what I had done before. Apparently they fixed what was wrong. Now I am attempting to use their system only to find badly designed features that create frustration and waste time. For example, when I want to communicate with another member who is a DNA match, a box comes up for that purpose. However the slightest accidental touch on the screen outside this box causes it to disappear along with all the work that has already been put into the message. Which often is considerable. Also temporary navigation away from the screen, for example to check genealogical information needed in the message, also causes this badly designed message box to abort. Another badly designed feature is that the program requires a sign-in after it thinks that there has been no activity for an hour. However, it doesn't know when you've been hard at work on a message during that time so when you ""send"" the message it makes you sign in again but of course it fails to save the message on which you've spent time and effort.

We know these incompetent design features occur when (1) management that neither understands the intricacies of daily computer use nor actually uses the features gives orders or (2) IT people who design these features fail to understand practical use and then fail to double-check their choices by actually using them, I mean substantial use not just a quick check, are the ones making decisions.

Another commenter mentioned the MTHFR mutations, which are associated with many chronic illnesses. Geneticgenie.org will run your 23andMe results specifically related to these genes, and the report is free.

I did my test with 23andme in 2014 and the results came after about 9 weeks. It was incredible and fascinating to see the information provided in this test and my parents and grandparents always to me I was an equal mixture of English, Scottish and Irish. (Our family names for generations pretty much also reflect the links to Great Britain.) 23andme confirmed what my grandparents on both side of our family had been telling me when I was very young.This was so interesting, that I bought another 23andMe test kit for my wife.

23andme nearly overwhelmed me with information not only in regard to where I came from, but with information about possible health issues I could probably have. I'm about to turn 66 as I write my review, and I'll say looking back at my medical ailments over the years, the health info was about 98% accurate, despite missing multiple sclerosis (which I was diagnosed with at age 60) and 23andme suggested I am prone to psoriasis (which I nor any member of my family has ever had.

My major disappointment with 23andme came earlier this year (2017) when they sent out info stating they were going to be selling my (and everyone else's data) to third party entities. Like Hell, I want my personal information to be sold to a corporation! I sent 23andme an email telling them to drop me as a customer, and that I did NOT want them releasing my personal information to anyone.

About 10 days later I received an email from them staying my account was closed and all I have now are some vague memories of the maps on 23andme showing migration patterns of my ancestors, some recollections of other info and questions as to why long-after I paid my $200, 23andme decided to ""prostitute"" me (and everyone else using their DNA test kit) AFTER I agreed to their original terms back in 2014.

I'd love to meet Anne Wojcicki (CEO and co-founder of 23andme) so I could say to her in my bad impression of Arnold Schwarzenegger voice, ""Hasta la vista baby, I WON'T be back."" And neither will my wife!",2017-08-19 00:00:00

After 3 months I get a notice that my sample wasn't good enough to provide analysis. Do they say they are shipping out a replacement? No, that is what an honest company would do. Instead they say if I want to try again I can order a new kit (at no cost at least) from the provided link.... of course the link is broken. What a major scam they are hoping to keep my money and not do the work. I contacted support for a working link... *crickets*. I will also be filing a complaint with the FTC and FDA. (FDA has cracked down on them in the past for shady practices).",2018-02-07 00:00:00

GF's experience: She absolutely loved this thing. The process to submit your DNA was very easy and the results even came back quicker than expected. You get a ton of interesting data; and as 23andMe obtain more participants, you'll only get more data/reports! It's really cool to have this information.

My personal experience: Mine wasn't so great. I like the concept of the product/service. So in order to get them your DNA, all you do is spit in a tube and send it off. The issue with me was I guess they couldn't extract enough DNA from my saliva so they couldn't process it. Bummer, right? The good thing is that they give you 2 options, They will send another kit to you for free or refund your purchase. I opted for the new kit. I send in my saliva. Same result, not enough DNA extracted. Sad. They then force you to take the refund (which isn't bad), but then they tell you in the future, if you use their products again, you will not be refunded. That makes sense from a business perspective, but I will probably never use their services again because of me not wanting to take that liability.",2017-09-28 00:00:00

For me, I got 99.9% South Asian. Are you kidding me? I could have said that without a $200 DNA test. For a population of over 1.3 billion people in India alone, 23andme can't find a proper DNA analysis for this population? Are they THAT lazy? For British Isles, or other small islands in Europe they could provide a detailed analysis of it including tiny regions.

I did a Genographic Project DNA test two years ago and that was more detailed that 23andme's terrible DNA result. 40% South East Asian, 30% South West Asian, 14% Mediterranean, 4% Northern European among others. Not only that, I was 2% Neanderthal and 3% Denisovan.

None of these results were on 23andme. Just 99.9% South Asian. I could have looked in the mirror to know that.

Sorry about my language, but that's what it is. A LAZY DNA test. Such a waste of my money and time.

I will not recommend 23andme to anybody. It's so White Anglo Saxon centric. 23andme should invest some more money for research of different population samples before going around advertising their product further.",2017-03-27 00:00:00

I work in research genetics and have analyzed SNP data markers on animals to confirm parentage. 23andMe takes your saliva, extracts your DNA from cells, and runs qPCR against multiple SNP primers to see if they get a hit. Small science lesson: A SNP is a small conserved basepair varient that can be present in multiple areas in your genetic DNA, primers target specific SNP area for a yes or no if it is present.

After analyzing the SNP data, 23andMe make information easily digestable by their presentation and graphics. I took mine mainly to get a few laughs about matching up my physical genetics. I want to get my sister one to settle a few bets. I also wanted to see if I was a carrier for any genetic diseases.

23andMe encourages seeing a genetic counselor for any questions. You shouldn't assume that just because you have a varient, that you have or will have the disease.

23andMe-DNA-Test-Ancestry-Personal,,Know what your expectations are before you buy,Deana E.,,,2,4.0,"I have seen this and other similar products before but never wanted to spend the money. When this was on the Black Friday deal, I thought 'why not'? I solicited friends and family feedback and I read the reviews, which are over the place. Some people are mad because it got their eye color wrong (Trait Reports), others think there is some conspiracy to get everyone's dna for nefarious reasons, and some even think the results are given to insurance companies! Back to Reality: before you do this, ask yourself what you REALLY want to know and what you expect to get out of this. This is NOT meant to give you definitive health information, but instead tells you if you have any of the genetic markers or variants that they test for; and they only test for SOME, not all. There are Genetic Health Risk reports, Carrier Status Reports, Wellness Reports and Trait Reports in addition to the Ancestry Reports.

Why did I purchase this and what did I like? The ancestry part wasn't a big deal for me. I'm not into genealogy, so it wasn't about finding my heritage, but I was curious if there were any surprises (none). The health component was my primary reason and I read the disclaimers (listed over and over). I found my report to be interesting and it has given me some things to look into for long term health reasons. As for the other reports, it was interesting to read the Wellness and Trait reports, and no, it didn't get everything right, but nor did I expect it to.

I didn't give it 5 stars because it told me I'm likely to weigh more than average! Ha ha ha!! Just kidding -- not about weighing more, that's true -- but that isn't why I didn't give it 5 stars. I'm not sure you could really rate a tool like this 5 stars, but it is something I definitely recommend!

That said, I've viewed the results for my husband and it's very interesting to look through. I think we knew what we were going to see and weren't surprised to get the results he did. The predisposition to diseases was at least an interesting read, though they stress that environment and other factors play a big role in your chances of actually acquiring any of the mentioned diseases/disorders.

UPDATE: On the first day over 8 weeks, I sent an email to customer support saying that I hadn't seen any progress from essentially step 2 after they receive it and just wanted an update. I received a very courteous response saying that they were moving my sample to the front and that I would be receiving a free code for another kit!

23andMe-DNA-Test-Ancestry-Personal,,"Expectations need to be lowered, and some of what is being sold is not accurate.",Dwight G. Chapin,,,21,2.0,"I think my expectations were a little high going into this, which resulted in being unhappy with the overall experience.

Positives: Seeing the connection with family members, including my brother and daughter. I had no doubt of the relationship, but in a strange way seeing the genetic connection felt good.

Negatives:
1: It takes too long to get your result. I understand the testing needs time, and I am sure they have a lot of samples every day. The problem was with how long it took to get from me to the actual testing center. I think the overall time to get my results...that more than half of that time was waiting for the item to ship back. It seemed to get held up at one point for two weeks. This also happened with my daughters sample. It is already a long process which can take over a month, so I don't know why it bottlenecks so much from just shipping alone.

2: I took another test from another company, and found my genetic history to be different. It was not a small difference. After the fact I discovered that each place uses different ways of looking at the DNA which results in a percentages being different. It would not bother me if we were talking a 1 or 2 percent, but one background was 10% different from one test to the other. It feels weird to tell someone I am 30% something when another company says I am 40%. Also, that other company took about half as long from start to finish to get my results.

3: Almost everyone of the results for things like going bald to which finger was longer was wrong. Some of them would even say that there was only a 50ish percent chance you would have this trait or another, which is almost a flip of the coin. That entire section seemed worthless. The few things that were right at first made me think ""Cool"" but after thinking about anyone could have randomly guess about the same number based on no information at all.

4: Because of the above problems with how wrong it was on traits, it made me doubt almost everything other than the fact that it picked out relatives. I paid for the higher priced package, and I think I wasted money doing so.

The bottom line, you need to understand that outside seeing relatives, I don't know how accurate this actually is. If you are thinking of doing this, my recommendation is to save money and get the base test, which at least seems accurate. I think anything more is a waste of money at this time.",2018-07-11 00:00:00

My only advice is, don't bother buying the health part, for which you'll pay extra. I did and it basically told me nothing and it's confusing to say the least. A friend said, ""well, it told me I have excessive ear wax"". So if you feel the need to know such things, go for it. All I can say is, she got more info than I.",2018-12-09 00:00:00

I initially did not want to spend this kind of money, and then while I was pregnant I joined a study and got one for free. Well, now I have bought more of these kits than I'd like to admit to. Everyone I have given one to absolutely loves them. They make a perfect gift for anyone who has everything already. I do like that the less expensive version can be upgraded as well, if you can't splurge for the complete kit all at once. The health information alone is fascinating. I found out I'm a carrier of Cystic Fibrosis (a terrible genetic disorder causing lung and digestive problems), but fortunately my husband is not so we don't have to worry about any children having this condition.",2018-07-22 00:00:00

We figured it would be a popular Christmas gift and didn‚Äôt know if there would be a Christmas rush (there could be! Haha) After we sent the kits in, We received update emails throughout the process. We sent them in around December 1. I received my results on January 12 and my husband received his results on January 22. Since this time, I received an email stating they were going to update our information to include 2 breast cancer genes.

23andMe-DNA-Test-Ancestry-Personal,,More compelling results than Ancestry...,C. Okamuro,,,13,4.0,"There are a variety of home testing DNA kits out there, but it feels like 23andMe and Ancestry may be the most popular ones in the US (or at least they appear to be the most heavily marketed). The popularity of the kits is integral with their value in that the larger the customer base (and therefore the pool of DNA results), the more family matches and genome insights you are likely to find. That's the main value in trying more than one kit.

The collection process is not a big deal... a bit of saliva in a tube, a prepaid mailer, and a registration code to match the kit to your online account. Budget a few minutes for all of that, but be sure to follow the guidelines regarding food/gum/beverages. From mailing to receipt of results was about 3 weeks, but your mileage may vary.

I bought the ancestry + health testing, and it resulted in 91 reports (5 ancestry, 43 carrier status, 9 genetic risk, 26 traits, and 8 wellness). Actually, it was significantly fewer, but your your results get updated as 23andMe add new genetic tests and screens. I haven't accessed the results via the web portal, so I can't speak to its interface, but I do use the Android app. The interface of the app works well. Some of the more sensitive test results (like BRCA1/2) are initially put behind a readme layer; you at least have to scroll through the writeup about what the test result means before you can have access to the result.

Because of the health results, I found the overall results to be more interesting than what I got from Ancestry. The genealogy results were similar, but not identical, owing to the different pools of subjects. That's the main reason why I recommend using more than one test... you'll have a better representation of your DNA relatives than if you only use a single provider's test.",2018-07-01 00:00:00

Yet to be fair ancestry DNA results I received were from a few years back and am sure they have collected and are able to perform more details then they had when I used it. I am very excited to see my results with 23and Me and know that the more family that take this DNA or any DNA product the better my over all results will be. I look forward to comparing my results with my nephew and as will be purchasing one for my mother to compare her results with ours.

They received and passed my sample on the 18th. It's been in the ""Isolating and purifying your DNA"" status for 10 days. It takes only several hours to isolate and purify DNA for testing. Why 10 days? I know they do batch testing, but MY sample shouldn't be held up just because some other sample in the batch is having issues, IMO. If there is an issue, I should have heard from them about it.

I was really looking forward to this process and receiving the results but, at this rate, it'll be June or something before I get them. I hear ancestry doesn't take as long. I wish I'd gone that route. Feel like I wasted $200 right now.",2018-03-28 00:00:00

Again, no status update until another month, they decided to send me another kit.. It's been more than 4 months now since my first sample arrived at their lab, the status is still at DNA extraction. Customer service was not able to provide any helpful information or actions. The whole process really only take a few days as I have friend who got his results in a week.

There is also a tool that allows you to see anyone you match up with in the 23&me DNA database, and how closely you are related. Our family found a surprising family member, and it‚Äôs possible you might, too!

It was very interesting to see all the details about genetic diseases, personal characteristics and ancestry. There are lots of questionaires on the website that take some time. I guess this helps them study people's genetic profiles. I did not participate in many of them. You also have the option to stay private, which I did.

23andMe-DNA-Test-Ancestry-Personal,,The DNA test itself is fine and useful IF you are looking for DNA relatives ...,Heather B,,,6,2.0,"The DNA test itself is fine and useful IF you are looking for DNA relatives or you buy and upload results to promethease.com, which will tell you everything that is published on SNPedia about your genes and is only $5.00; BUT the company 23andme is a mess! Their website is a mess!
In the first place, they don't really distinguish, when setting up your account, which questions are required to set up your account and which are voluntary to help them with research. That is frustrating. A person should be able to tend to the important agreements and know they're done with those and that their account is set up before being asked what probably amounts to (not exaggerating) 10-15 hours of health questions.
In any case, realizing that somehow I'd gotten onto that treadmill and it wasn't going to end, I tried over the course of 3 days and put over 8 hours into attempting resolve a website glitch that would allow a person to choose whether they did or didn't want their sample stored for further research.

I had friends over to see if they could figure out the problem. I called and wrote to customer service.- two different branches of the company - and they didn't seem to care. Their customer service is the worst! They just refer you to their website! By the time my sample had arrived at the company, it was too late to change anything (although I did spend another 2 hours trying to do so!)

So, basically, if you're having trouble with the website, they say: Go to the website!

Specifically, I'd say, ""Hey, I'm having trouble with this link. It's not taking me to the page where I can choose to have my sample stored! My friends have come over to see if I'm an idiot or what the problem is, we've spent hours and hours trying to solve this... Here's the browser I'm using, blah, blah..."" and probably no less than 15 times, I was referred to the link that wasn't working, or a different one that linked to it and then asked to rate their customer service!""

It was infuriating!

23andMe-DNA-Test-Ancestry-Personal,,Truly the gift of discovery,Dennis Kearney,,,1,5.0,"Kit promptly arrived and instructions were clear and easy to follow.
It took about 4 weeks to get the results, including some unexpected ancestry.
It's been truly the ""gift of discovery"" for us.
It was very exciting to uncover our genetic heritage, long-lost second cousins, and obtain some health information.
There is also lot of fluff that is fun to read through and compare with family and friends. (attached ear lobes, ability to taste bitter, etc)
Now, others members of my family also want to get tested :D",2018-01-06 00:00:00

23andMe-DNA-Test-Ancestry-Personal,,Waste of time and money,SBF,,,5,1.0,"If you know anything about your own health and ancestry, this will not give you any more information and is a waste of money. For the ancestry portion, my mother was an immigrant, so I know that side. As a woman, they gave me no information about my father's side, because I didn't get his Y chromosome. His family has been in the US since the 1600's and I got ZERO information about him.
For the health risks, they didn't tell me anything I don't already know and actually didn't get some things right.
Sure you get plenty of raw genetic data, but there is no way to interpret it. The trait predictions were almost 100% wrong. e.g. I am a redhead and it said I didn't carry that trait. Same for a cleft chin.
800 number provided no help and told me I should do a google search to find someone who could interpret the raw data. REALLY!? What are you charging people for? Don't use this.",2018-05-17 00:00:00

The health insight stuff is interesting but it guessed my attributes wrong (morning vs night person, ability to grow a beard, i have a full beard it said I would more than likely not be able to grow one.., my hair color was defiantly wrong and disappointing).

23andme breaks down your genetic percentages from round the world. Not only that, but they can tell you if you have recessive Gene traits and whether they are expressed or not.

I learned a lot about my ancestry. I had also tried Vitagene, and it was NOT a accurate in terms of ancestry. The results of that were so bad that I wonder if they got my sample mixed up with someone else. 23 and Me is the real deal, and VERY accurate. I discovered I have a bunch of second and third cousins I knew nothing about! And my ancestry reports were spot on from what I‚Äôve been told my whole entire life.

The health portion is interesting. I opted out to learn if I am predisposed to Alzheimer‚Äôs or Parkinson‚Äôs disease since neither are curable, and life gives us enough to worry about. But it did detect other conditions, one of which I knew I had- a blood disorder (it mentioned that I have an increased risk of developing blood clots- it didn‚Äôt mention the name of my disorder though). It also said I am at slight increase of age related macular degeneration. So I am going to be taking lutein and vitamin A now!

It also told me that my middle toe is shorter than my big toe, this isn‚Äôt true lol. But everything else was. I am less than average weight with an atheletic build. I am not lactose intolerant, nor am I celiac. A diet high in fat is unlikely to impact my weight unless I exceed my daily caloric intake. You will learn little tidbits like this about yourself that I feel can be very useful! Some of it you will already know- for instance I am not a deep sleeper, but I had no idea that there was a genetic component to this.

I also learned that I have a lot of Neanderthal DNA, which is a bit weird, and I am still not sure what that means. Anyway, this is very interesting and highly recommend!",2018-01-30 00:00:00

He tried to track the genealogy, but couldn't confirm what she said. But she insisted. Who knows who to trust? Trust your DNA!! Very simple spit-in-tube kit. Just remember to tell them to register and to do it for the correct kit. I had to remind my dad, and he had to go back and fix it, as he choose just ancestry at first. Luckily, his kit had not been sent in yet. His medical-ish side told him about a few diet ideas and was positive got a marker for some artery disease, which his EKGs are always borderline, so it's nice to know why and what to pay attention to.

Finally, I know genetics do not equal destiny, but I am perplexed at how far off many of the ‚Äúphysical traits‚Äù and predispositions in the ‚Äúwellness reports‚Äù came out. I Find it likely that they are not analysing things deeply enough, perhaps using incomplete or misguided datasets. If you must absolutely get a DNA kit, I would suggest trying the competition: it could hardly be worse than this, and at least you will get a more detailed and specific ancestry analysis.

It may be a little scary to see what your DNA holds - but keep in mind, epigenetics tells us DNA is NOT everything - lifestyle is SOOO much more impactful. Think good thoughts, keep stress levels low and eat well - steps I can take to keep bad DNA from expressing itself.

The customer respresentative was extremely rude when I expressed concern that it seemed like my kit was lost. She just kept repeating her script. When I asked to speak to her supervisor, she asked me why, and then refused to allow me to speak to her supervisor. Then, she yelled at me telling me that I need to wait two weeks more before I can report that my kit is lost. Fortunately for me, the kit was not lost; but, as the far as keeping you posted on when they receive your kit and the status of your results do not really keep you updated because they don‚Äôt really update the status (and that is using their app). When you call, you are just told the standard, ‚Äúyou must wait x amount of weeks‚Äù before they can tell you anything about your kit.

Also I am wondering how accurate this is. My mother 0.4% of some Jewish group and those do not show up in my genetic history at all.

23andMe-DNA-Test-Ancestry-Personal,,Only useful if you have one of the very rare diseases 23andMe screens for. Otherwise Ancestry.com or Genographic is more helpful,Uberdoc,,,32,3.0,"I had high hopes for the results from 23andMe's DNA testing. Would it show me my risk for Alzheimer's disease, or my risk for developing type 2 diabetes? Would it tell me my risk for dying from coronary artery disease, or developing Parkinson's disease (both type 2 diabetes and Parkinson's disease are hot research areas for Google - the wife of founder Sergei Brin is one of the owners of 23andMe). No, unfortunately not. Instead, I learned that I am (thankfully!) not at risk for developing Glycogen Storage Disease Ib, or Bloom Syndrome, or Maple Syrup Urine disease type 1B. I also learned that I am not lactose intolerant (incorrect), and that I am unlikely to flush when I drink alcohol (correct). The testing linked me to 3500 distant 3rd to 5th cousins with whom I share only minimal DNA, which I did not find very useful.
Prior to my purchasing the the $199 Health and Ancestry 23andMe testing kit, I did review the slick and well done 23andMe website and watched several of the videos. I researched the background behind the company, and the prior changes in testing and controversies behind some of the earlier tests run by 23andMe. The kit directions are very straight-forward, and the sample collection is easy. 23andMe states that you should allow up to 6 weeks for the sample results to be posted on-line, but mine and my wife's were up in about three weeks. The on-line reports are very nicely laid out, with very good explanations of the results.
All in all, I feel the usefulness of the 23andMe testing is still evolving. Hopefully as better DNA testing is developed, the test results will become more helpful for those of us that want to predict our chances of developing the more common disease states that kill or cripple us, rather than the oddball rarities that 23andMe currently tests for.",2016-12-30 00:00:00

23andMe-DNA-Test-Ancestry-Personal,,I found it worth the money.,B. Ahmed,,,53,4.0,"I did the Ancestry DNA test before this one and I wasn't happy with the results. I thought they were too vague and generalized. I know both my parents and I wanted to see how 23andme would come out.
This kit took less than 3 weeks to get results and I was glad I took it. My mother is 100% Bosnian and I tested at 49.5% Southern European, which is true. The AncestryDNA test had me at 27% Eastern European (which is more Slovakia/Russia/Poland) and 17% Italy/Greece (maybe a better designation for this would be the Mediterranean). Anc does not have a designation for Southern European.
AncestryDNA found me at 42% West Asian and I have no Asian blood whatsoever. I am Egyptian on my father's side where 23andme found me to be more precise North Africa 36%/Middle East 5%. The rest was broadly Southern Europe. AncestryDNA has a designation for North Africa but it is more Northwest Africa (Tunisia, Algeria, Morocco) and did not include Egypt.
In this aspect, I am glad that I took this test. It was much more accurate and closer to what I actually am. I know people have migrated and moved across continents over time,but still, this test found me at very little Eastern European whereas AncestryDNA had me at a much higher percentage.
I am glad to have received different reports on what I may look like. Everything was accurate (dark hair, dark eyes), but my skin tone was off (light beige whereas I am much darker olive color) and it said I would have freckles (which I don't).
I know we inherit about 50% from each of the parents, but this test found me to be more European at 60% than AncestryDNA at 50%.23 found me at 10% broadly Southern European which includes the Mediterranean, since both my parents are Mediterranean. I am getting just the ancestry part of the test for my son to see how his Anc will differ from 23. I definitely found it worth the money, it was much more detailed and precise.",2016-10-06 00:00:00

I was surprised to see that my daughter had a significant amount of Eastern European/Jewish ancestry, since her great grandfather was born in a home for unwed, Catholic moms.
If you order this for the ancestry, you must be realistic. Some people are disappointed that the tests sometimes point to regions, instead of specific countries. Countries are political constructs. Do you really think the test can determine if you are Irish or English when people in that region basically share the same DNA? So be realistic in your expectations.",2017-07-10 00:00:00

Other buyers have tried to get their money back or their data, but 23andMe is not releasing the raw data they have on these SNPs that other users had just the month before. They report 23andMe is saying ""too bad, so sad, we don't recommend using raw data anyway"". I shouldn't have procrastinated- I thought, I will wait and do it.

23andMe-DNA-Test-Ancestry-Personal,,Great Wealth of Knowledge and Interesting Finds,A. Hsiao,,,4,5.0,"I got the 23andMe DNA Test with the Health one and am very glad that I got the health one. I purchased this product on Prime day and shipped it out the next day after I received the package to spit into. It was an easy process to follow. All in all, it took around 5 weeks from sending to be completely processed with the report ready.

Let‚Äôs start with the providing the sample stage:
The instructions are in the box and are pretty clear of what you have to do. Make sure to register your sample with the website first or else there may be problems down the road. The part that I found most tricky was to actually provide the spit amount they required. My spit came out with a lot of bubbles which made it hard because they wanted liquid and not bubbles filled to a certain place. After spitting, there was this solution to cap off the tube. I then put it inside a bag and the box with the prepaid label. I would recommend taking a picture of the label since it has the tracking number in case something goes wrong. The tracking number should also be shown on the website but I heard from people that sometimes the one on website is inaccurate. Therefore, better safe than sorry.

The Wait:
Now that I sent it off via the post office, it was time to wait. I was a little worried about them receiving my package because they didn't log my package until approximately 2 weeks after tracking said the package was received. It then moved to the different stages of extraction pretty quickly. I got my results in about 5 weeks total from shipping it out.

The Results:
It actually shocked me quite a bit in how it can narrow my ethnicity down to a specific region and country. That's very awesome. When I got this kit, I was more excited for the health part though. It tells you what you are potentially a carrier for, what your genetic health risk is. When clicking into each one, it provides a description of what gene/strand is causing an increased risk which in my opinion is very interesting. It can also tell you things about your traits such as whether or not you are likely to have dimples. Mine were mostly correct except for one or two. For 100 dollars that I paid on prime day, I think this is well worth it!",2018-11-08 00:00:00

23andMe-DNA-Test-Ancestry-Personal,,Disappointing.,Donna Manning,,,3,3.0,"I have mixed feelings as of today. I am an ""old"" customer, we did ours around 2011. In 2013 the FDA made them remove all their health reports. I was hopeful all would work out and things would return back to the way they were, or something similar. Well... they eventually did. Unfortunately they left their older customers in the dust. They archived all my health information, so I can see it... but it is in PDF form. It is not interactive and I cannot compare it to anyone. I got my sister and my best friend on 23 and Me recently, hoping to do this very thing. Unfortunately all either of us see for me is ""not available"". I can see all their exciting information just fine, but if I want to see mine I have to go download the PDF and sift through it.

If they are going to keep older customers on a lesser platform every time they do updates then maybe we should be told about it. I would think with a service like this they would keep everyone on the same page, or at least as close as they could. They still have my health data, and my DNA sample. There really is very little reason they shouldn't update customers to the same levels.

Color me disappointed. I have told so many people about this over the years that wound up buying the kits but I didn't realize they were doing this to older customers until I saw what my sister and best friend can see on their's. Mine is void of all the data I once saw. It is a shame. If I put my kids on it, which they want me to, I will be unable to compare anything with them either. So I guess my choices are to forget about it or start all over again- which is ridiculous.",2018-04-18 00:00:00

When you 1st get your results back you may be disappointed in the info that is given - it's extremely basic and things you already know, like whether you can smell asparagus in your pee (who cares about that?! odds are you already know that and don't need a test to tell you that). Certain gene mutations will pop up on 23andMe, I only had 1. You need to download the raw data and then upload it to a site that analyzes it for you, like Promethease, which is ten bucks. This site will show you all of your genetic mutations, rate them good, neutral, or bad. Then you can filter out to see what is of real concern. The drug interactions were very surprising to me - for instance, I shouldn't have certain blood thinners if I ever have a heart issue. That's good info to have! However, you can get the SAME raw data by just getting the ancestry kit. So save yourself 1/2 the cost and get the ancestry version.

23andMe-DNA-Test-Ancestry-Personal,,Useful For Learning,Sherla Holmes,,,6,5.0,"Got this during Prime Day so paid $100 plus sales tax for the health + ancestry report. Was afraid at first because I wasn't sure if it was legit, being on Amazon and being sold by a 3rd party. But turns out it is legit - same as ordering directly from 23andMe, no difference - except if you order directly from 23andMe you don't pay sales tax (but pay shipping), while on Amazon you pay sales tax (but get free Prime delivery). Awesome deal for $100 really!

Test kit arrived in 2 days. Followed instructions, which was really easy since it's all clearly written and illustrated. Sent it back.

I registered my details online and completed some of the surveys/interviews. I had to answer many questions about illnesses that I never even knew existed! There was also these questions about how much I exercised and how much veggies I ate. After doing the surveys, it made me realize that my health & fitness isn't as good as I'd like - and this realization actually made me implement immediate changes in my lifestyle. And I haven't even got my DNA results yet!

Anyway, it's my first time doing DNA testing, so I learned quite a bit about how it works which makes it an interesting experience. 23andMe also makes the learning rather friendly for the layperson to understand. They might have done too good a job because with my newfound knowledge I spotted an amusing error on their website! It's for the tutorial about how we inherit one chromosome from our mother and one from our father. In the illustration, they showed father as XX instead of XY, so it appeared like two lesbians gave birth to me! Looks like a very tired graphic artist had to hurry this off and no one saw the mistake. ;)

Anyway, it's been 3 weeks since I sent back my results. There's a progress bar showing that my test results are halfway through the analysis process. Will update again when it's completed. I'm especially curious because there's not much in the database about my known ethnicity.",2017-08-11 00:00:00
23andMe-DNA-Test-Ancestry-Personal,,These tests have recently changed! Beware before you spend your money,Kindle Customer,,,3,1.0,"When I ordered this test it was ONLY to have certain Gene's tested for (for my 6 month old son, for health and genetic reasons). But I read after ordering it that its hard to get enough saliva from a 6 month old. So I left it sitting in the box it was delivered in, on my table for the past 2 months untouched. I just read an article recently that 23andme was just bought by another company and no longer tests for those Genes any longer. So this is completely useless to me and still in the original box and plastic. I am technically out of my refund window but really REALLY hoping someone will contact me regarding this and give me an exception since this was never even opened. My doctor charges alot to do this gene testing and I NEED to be refunded in order to be able to afford this.

23andMe-DNA-Test-Ancestry-Personal,,You may be an ancestor by the time you get your results,cjr,,,1,3.0,"Three stars, as I am very neutral on this products - not loving or hating it.

I liked that it arrived quickly and the instructions were very easy to follow. Swab your check a few minutes, put swab in tube, mail off, make sure you've created your account online and you're finished. The test is pretty forgiving as well, as my wife made a few mistakes in the process but results came back just fine.

My biggest complaint is our neighbors ordered one of the many other kits out there AFTER we were talking about it one night and had already ordered ours. They not only mailed theirs in after us, but had their results back a few weeks earlier. Our results took about 2 months to get back to us - by then much of the excitement and anticipation was gone, though it was still neat to see what they were.

These worked fine but for the price, I would recommend trying one of the many others out there. You'll get the same information, just a lot sooner. If they're on a great sale, or you're not really not an impatient person in the slightest, these will likely work fine for you.",2018-12-18 00:00:00

DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY on a health kit!! It doesn't give much information. For the 50 something health assessments, it told me I'm 3% more likely to weigh more than the average person. I already knew that- I'm round. It told me I'm 4% more likely to prefer Savory flavors over sweet.
It said if I eat a diet in saturated fats, I'll weigh more. Duh!
The BASIC $99 kit is AWESOME. I gained a significant amount of information from that, including confirmation of questionable ancestry findings that I just wasn't sure were accurate- and now its confirmed through DNA that I DO have Scandinavian roots. Who knew? VERY exciting. Now I have to figure out what some of the DNA coding means and it was a hoot to look up relatives around the globe that I'm related to. Almost 2000 folks who have also done the 23andme test- even relatives in Australia!

It comes to you in a small box with return shipping included. You spit in the collection thing and drop it in the mall. In about 4 - 6 weeks for find out you a ton about your genetic makeup.

Pros:
1. Tells you fun facts like you may die of some horrible disease
2. Let's you know what your skin color probably is
3. Did you pass down horrible conditions to your kids? The test has you covered.
4. Guys, worried about going bald, it lets you know.

The test isn't 100% accurate, it's based on comparisons of people with similar traits. For me it got a few things wrong like it said I may have freckles and I don't but your results are updated as more information comes in and as the testing improves.

Cons:
1. If you worry about stuff like horrible life ending diseases, genetic conditions, and general sadness maybe skip the heath section and just spring for the ansestry portion.
2. It's not 100% accurate which can be a blessing. Many environmental factors affect your heath. Like the test can't predict you being killed in a pickle eating contest, so worrying about Parkinson's would have been a waste of time.

Suspect it may be a kit or lab problem with them but unclear at this point.

I am so so happy I chose this company above all of the others. I did some research ahead of time on what each company offered, and I liked the fact that 23andMe provides health background information, and that they are conducting research on a regular basis (which you can voluntarily participate in) to benefit our collective knowledge about health and hereditary factors that affect health. I also like the fact that you pay a one-time fee, and then you have access to the website, their forums for discussions, customer service staff, and others who have joined, on an on-going basis. As an adoptee, it has been fantastic to find biological relatives who have been able to share stories and history of my biological family with me. I knew so little when I started, and I have an amazing family tree built now that spans centuries. I have relatives that have now joined 23andMe also, and the collective information is really helpful to families looking at health and patterns over generations.

I had already purchased a kit for my husband and one for my son (in the past 6 months) at the full price of $199, obviously we all liked it or I wouldn't be buying another. The Ancestry part was spot on. Also, the 23 and me database was able to correctly identify two family cousins (we didn't even know they had done the testing). It also offered a list of probable second and third cousins who we are attempting to contact. I was impressed at the size of the 23 and me database. We are also very interested in the Health profile. This service offers a tremendous amount of raw data, but offers little in depth interpretation. In order to gain better insight to our health profile, we first used geneticgenie.com (for free analysis) and then also paid the $5 to Prometheus.com. Very interesting results. In fact, I feel the Health Profile was more useful than the ancestry. The ancestry was fun, but the health profile identifies gene mutation information which was very helpful for prescribing medications.

Providing the sample is very easy. You provide your saliva by spitting into a tube, then when you close the tube a preservative is added. The sample is then capped, bagged and returned to 23andme in the provided and readdressed, postage paid box. The hardest part is the waiting on your results! Took about 5 weeks in the past. I suspect it might take a week or so longer this time just because of the special price of the Prime Day deal.

Very professional looking. Results came back 6-8 weeks later. We understand it isn't an exact science & we receive frequent requests to fill out information to help their research. It also means we have access to ongoing reports. I don't know what the accuracy rate is but I'm 1/2 Swedish--my grandmother came from Sweden & all previous generations lived there. My report said I had a small portion of Swedish blood from several generations back. I think health information comes from the surveys not from the blood analysis. As more people answer surveys, it'll give a clearer picture concerning various genetic dispositions that may or may not apply to your blood type. I don't like that the reports aren't mailed to us, it's on-line & it is confusing as it isn't a continuous document. We bought this on a special 2 for 1 sale & at $99 each, it was still pricey for what you get.

Contrary to what I've read on a couple of websites, you DO receive your mt-DNA, and if you are a male, your y-DNA test results as well. In 23andMe you also receive you autosomal test results, aka ""family finder"" DNA results, all in one bundle at one time cost. Yes, it is true, 23andMe has a large data base and many people do not want to share their results, but is that a bad thing? You can share with whom you want, or not at all, that is your choice. 23andMe also tests for 39 medical carrier variants. With Family Tree DNA testing you can dwell deeper and more precise than the other tests, however, each test will costs you more.

I would like to know percentage of Irish ancestry compared to British and Scottish. Also, nobody wants a broad range of multiple areas of Europe. We want specific data. But it is clear to me that I come from Great Britain, France and Germany mainly. I really like how you can select the confidence interval for your ancestry results. The default is 50%, but you can select up to 90%. At 90% confidence interval I am only 7% from Great Britain/Ireland for certain, but I have high percentages in the broad categories that include those areas as well. As you reduce your confidence interval, the numbers are reallocated from the broad categories and change. I also like the 23 chromosome map where you can see specifically where each region is located in your chromosomes. And I like that it matches you with your relatives all over the world. The health report is helpful - I am thankful it stated I am not a carrier of any of the the disease or disorders they test for.",2017-08-12 00:00:00
23andMe-DNA-Test-Ancestry-Personal,,If you know the limitations you are likely to be very satisfied,J. Kuehn,,,0,5.0,"Based on some of the reviews, it probably would help to have some level of knowledge about genetics so you would know more about the limitations of the reporting. And the granularity of the reporting is going to be based on the size of the database. Until there is a substantial increase of, say, Asians subscribing, the results are likely to be limited. Finding relatives is going to be limited by the number of DNA relatives who have subscribed to the service. And this is true for any of the DNA test sites. For me, I found it interesting, enlightening, and in some cases the results have been humorous. And as the databases become larger there are likely to be more direct correlations between one's DNA and diseases or traits.",2018-01-04 00:00:00

23andMe-DNA-Test-Ancestry-Personal,,"Easy to Submit for Test. Some Results Were Important, Other Results Didn't Matter To Me.",Blossoms,,,48,3.0," UPDATE (9-30-2016) I received my results online, and here are my thoughts:

I was very interested in the following results:
1. Haplogroups. It tells me where a small portion of my ancestors originated thousands of years ago, and what ancestor groups I am assigned to based on certain genetic variants.
2. Ancestry Composition: This breaks down what percentage of each ancestry I am composed of.
3. Carrier Status: Tell me what genes I am a carrier for, and whether or not this may affect me. This is great information so I can also test my children in the future to see if they have carried anything I would have. This does not tell you whether you are a carrier from the mother of the father. The mother and the father both have to do the 23andMe test in order for you to find out. Examples of such variants that were included in the report:
-Beta Thalassemia and Related Hemoglobinopathies
-Cystic Fibrosis
-Glycogen Storage Disease Type la
-MCAD Deficiency

Information that I already knew, but was still included in the report:
1. My hair color
2. Whether or not I was Lactose Intolerant
3. How deep is my sleep
4. My eye color
5. Whether or not I have freckles
6. Finger Length Ratio
7. Whether or not I have a unibrow
8. ‚ÄúYou are not likely to sneeze when suddenly exposed to bright sunlight‚Äù‚Ä¶Yes, I already knew that!
9. Whether or not I can taste certain bitter compounds. I have a pretty good sense of taste, and can taste a lot of foods pretty well, including bitter or sweet. So this was no surprise to me either.

There are other results which I thought were not correct, but were included in the report.
1. My Skin color is not light, and the report says I have light/fair skin, and excluded olive from my results, even though olive skin can be part of the results. I do have olive skin (take a look at my other video reviews and you will see my skin color)
2. I have a longer second toe than my big toe. But the report tells the opposite. I can just look at my feet to tell that my second toe is longer.
3. ‚ÄúYou are not likely to have cheek dimples‚Äù statement is incorrect. I have cheek dimples when I smile, and I am actually pretty known to my friends and family for having dimples. My husband loves them!

This result made me laugh out loud:
‚ÄúYou are likely to be able to smell the asparagus metabolite in your pee‚Äù. My question is, why asparagus in particular? How about apples, broccoli, fish, parsley, or any other foods that I normally enjoy? I don‚Äôt eat asparagus that much anyways to justify having these specific results in the report. And I don‚Äôt think that this information was important for me anyhow.

The 23andMe reports can be plugged into other websites and genetic tests for free or at cost to detect other tests and results. I think that the price is a little too much for the information that was given to me, especially because I already knew some of these results anyways. I would love to be able to pick and choose what information can be included on my test, which can affect the price and can reduce it significantly, especially had I excluded a lot of the information on there that are less important to me.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ORIGINAL REVIEW:
The 23andMe kit is intended for DNA testing. The results of this test can show different genetic factors such as gene mutations, certain diseases, etc. It includes 65+ personalized results of your genetics. The nice thing about 23andMe test kit is that I was able to do this from the comfort of my own home. I did not need to go see a doctor, nor did I need to go visit the lab and get poked with needles. It makes it easy and convenient, especially because I was able to send in my samples via mail, without having to drop them off myself at a lab. Another convenient feature is that I will receive my results via email. This not only ensures privacy (mailed confidential information can be risky sometimes), but it also makes it faster for me to receive the results and not waiting the extra time for mailed documents.

This is the first part of my review. Since the results will take 6-8 weeks, I will update my review in more detail to include what type of information the results will discuss.

When the 23andMe kit arrived in the mail, I was very anxious to try this. However, there are some steps that have to be followed first before sending in the sample.

1. Must first register your information using the website that is included inside the kit.
2. When registering, you will provide your name, date of birth, as well as an email address.
3. Confirm your email address using the confirmation link provided
4. There is a barcode number inside the kit. The barcode is located on the saliva sample collection tube. This number must be entered online.
5. Agree to the 23andMe privacy policy and consent forms
6. Confirm your information, and you are ready to send in your saliva sample
7. You can also fill out a profile online, which can be shared with anyone you would like
8. There will be a registration confirmation email to follow, which lists the barcode number you provided, as well as your name.
9. You can also enter a different name other than yourself if you are not the one providing the saliva sample.

I have taken a measurement of the collection tube, which is about 6‚Äù long. However, the amount of saliva you would need to provide is much smaller than the length of the tube itself. It only took me about 3 minutes total to reach the ""fill line"".
I collected my saliva samples and here is my experience:

1. I must not eat or drink anything for 30 minutes prior to collection. I drank a glass of water about 45 minutes before collection time, and this helped with making sure that there was enough liquid in my system in order to provide a saliva sample (highly recommend this step)
2. I started spitting into the tube, and I noticed there were bubbles inside. A trick that I used, which I did not see listed on the instruction manual, is to tap the tube gently to remove any bubbles. Tapping the tube gently on a solid surface made the collection go faster and smoother.
3. The wide funnel is such a great idea! This is a great feature to have, and I wish more companies can start adding funnels to their collection tubes. This made sure that all of the saliva goes into the tube, and not on the floor or on my clothes.
4. The saliva must reach the fill line shown on the tube. Again, drinking water really helps with this.
5. After I the fill line has been reached, I closed the funnel lid until I heard a loud click. The clicking sound will release the liquid that is inside the lid. This is a stabilizing liquid.
6. After the stabilizing liquid mixed with the saliva, I unscrewed the funnel from the tube and discarded it. There is a small blue cap (see photos) that can be used to close the tube. Then I gently shook the capped tube for about 5 seconds.
7. There is a plastic bag that is included with the 23andMe kit. I put the collection tube inside, and sealed the bag. There is a white colored absorbent pad that is inside the bag. This pad must stay inside, and not to be removed.
8. I placed the sealed bag inside the box. The box also comes with a pre-sealed adhesive strip to close it.
9. Shipping for the box has already been prepaid. The bottom of the box includes a paid-for shipping label through FedEx Express. It is a Priority Overnight shipping label. However, please be aware on which day to send this sample. The shipping label indicated to return the box Monday through Friday.

Included is a short video which shows the contents of the 23andMe kit. I hope that this review was helpful for you! I will update my review as soon as I get the results.

P.S. The 23andMe Kit was provided at little or no cost to thoroughly test and give my opinion, and I never let that influence how I rate or review a product. Also, I make no promise of a good rating while testing a product. I have found that writing reviews has become an enjoyable hobby of mine. I love it when I know that I have made people's day when writing a helpful review (if not, why). Please let me know if you have any questions or comments about the 23andMe Kit, and I promise to answer them as quickly as possible (usually within 24 hours) based on my experience with the product.",2016-08-31 00:00:00

23andMe-DNA-Test-Ancestry-Personal,,"Easy-to-use testing kit offers basic, helpful reports and provides gateway to more information",Reviewer Dr. Beth,,,18,4.0,"NOTE: I received a free sample of the 23andMe Kit to try for review purposes. I am an amateur, unpaid reviewer and received absolutely NO compensation beyond this free product sample.

I have done a little research into genealogy with the assistance of my father-in-law, who is very active in this area. I am also very health-conscious. Both of these things contributed to me being curious about having genetic testing done, so I was excited to have the opportunity to use 23andMe.

The kit shipped to me quickly. The instructions for how to provide your sample (you are basically spitting your salvia into a plastic test tube) are very clear. The kit is return postage paid and couldn't be easier to use. You must create an account online with 23andMe before you return your kit so that your sample can be tracked and accounted for, but this was an easy process as well. I was told that the entire process would take 6-8 weeks, but it was MUCH faster than that! A little over a week after I sent my sample in, I received an email saying that it had been received, and just a few days after that, my reports were ready.

You have the option to choose whether you want the full reports or not. I choose to receive all of them: there are 39 carrier status, 3 ancestry reports, 7 wellness reports, and 19 trait reports. I will provide further information on each of these categories below.

The carrier status reports show whether yo may have a variant for particular kinds of diseases. These are definitely more rare genetic disorders that you would probably already know about if you had one of the--e.g., cystic fibrosis. The test does NOT test for any cancer risk, including breast cancer.

I found the wellness reports interesting. One thing it told me was that I was likely lactose intolerant--this is something I suspected about myself, but I have never been diagnosed. (I believe I have a mild case.) There is also information on how you react to low-fat diets as well as details about sleep, including whether you are likely to be a deep sleeper and have more movement in your sleep.

The ancestry reports were a bit disappointing. I came out 100% European, which is not really a surprise sine my mother's family is Italian and my father's familian is from Northern Europe. But the breakdowns given were more vague, with 6.8% of my ancestry somewhat unclassified as ""Broadly European.""

The summary offered by 23andMe explains that the traits reports provides information about ""how your DNA influences your physical appearance, preferences, and physical responses."" The information predicted here is interesting, but again, it is likely to mostly be things that you already know. For example, my report said that I have a 90% chance of darker eyes and 67% chance of dark brown hair--which is what I have. It also predicted that I have a 95% chance of NOT having a unibrow (thank goodness), although it was a little off in suggesting that there's a 70% chance that I don't have a widow's peak (I do have one).

These are just the basics from my 6-page summary report; 23andMe offers tons of additional research and data that you can pour over if you choose. Even better, the site allows you access to your raw data from your testing. You can download this information and share it with several other genetic testing sites (both free and paid) to get much, much more information. I have done this, I would say the ability to do this definitely makes the initial testing costs well worth the price. I also shared my data with my father-in-law, who informed me that what I received was MUCH more detailed and helpful than what he obtained from the site where he had his DNA testing performed (Ancestry).

In the end, I definitely would recommend 23andMe to anyone who is considering genetic testing.",2016-09-23 00:00:00

I bought 2 kits. I mailed in 2 kits on the same day. They tracked with each other day for day through the process until Analysis (same quality check, same extraction, entered Analysis the same). One kit had results August 11, well below the 6-8 weeks they represent. The other kit? Well, we're almost to 9 weeks without seeing results. And Customer Service can't seem to tell me anything other than it's been escalated. No estimated time frame for resolution. No offers of anything to attempt to make amends for the delay. Nothing but a very hollow apology.

More importantly, they offer two means of customer service: by e-mail and by phone. Do not ever waste your time on e-mailing them. All you will get is a form letter which indicates no one read your inquiry in the first place. Call them, and even then, you'll have to get to a higher level than the front line to get any results. Or at least I assume that you can get results; that remains to be seen on my end. At least the 2nd tier people will make a ticket with a number to make you feel like something might eventually happen.

The reports are cool, if you get them.
The data is interesting, if you get it.
There are some other nifty programs you can run the raw data through for more information, if you ever get your raw data.

As far as information about ancestry, it seems to me that Ancestry.com provided more accurate results or at least more specific results (Ancestry was more likely to name particular countries or groups of people from which my ancestors belonged, whereas 23andme was more likely to name an entire continent as my ancestral origin). The results between Ancestry.com and 23andMe were roughly similar, and I did like that 23andMe provides information about Neanderthal variants in your DNA.

23andMe's information regarding propensity for disease and other phenotypes was fascinating and seemed to be highly accurate for me. I also appreciate the ability to download the raw data for the purpose of seeking out more information.

I then noticed I started to gain more and more ancestors on this particular ethnicity which made it obvious that they had miscalculated or had not calculated it at all. To the extent they started removing people from my graph to make their error less obvious. They then changed the entire format of their site which made it a nightmare to navigate.

Ancestry report was mostly correct. Health reports were virtually nonexistent, or at least I can't find them. A couple of random health reports are there but the advertised ones are not. To add to the insult, we receive emails asking us to rate the reports we can't find (and I think didn't receive).

23andMe-DNA-Test-Ancestry-Personal,,Not very accurate - regret purchase,Fixer,,,3,1.0,"We actually know a fair bit of our ancestry. Thought maybe we could fine tune it. But this is so far off. For instance - we don't know of any southern European, yet this shows 22% of that. It got the Northwestern European right. Completely missed the known Native American of 6% (said <.1%). We know of 12% pure Turkish (Great Grandmother), yet it said .4% of ""Broadly Middle Eastern"". 12% Blond hair Blue-eyed Great Grandfather from Crimea but don't see that anywhere (sure it's possible he is from Scandinavia (though that says only .4%) or Germany but what are the chances?
I think if someone is white/European and they don't know specifics already, anything 23andMe puts on their report will be believable. But if you know things that don't show up...this raises the alarm bells and indicates deception or incompetence. The complete lack of positives in our case on two very-much known ancestry branches pretty much nullifies the accuracy of the test.
I would like to see someone send in two samples from the same person, or two brothers, and see if they end up different.
As far as the the trait reports - I think a dice roll would have been more accurate.
The so-called ""medical"" information - completely useless.
Overall, I would say this is a complete waste of money and I regret purchasing it. I really should get my money back.",2017-09-24 00:00:00

23andMe-DNA-Test-Ancestry-Personal,,fustrating experience,Liz,,,10,1.0,"My husband and I purchased two of these kits. We mailed them in on the same day. Now, over two months later, he's had his results for weeks and I'm still waiting. We had wanted to do this together and despite both kids being purchased together there is no option to hold up results until both are back. It's like sitting in a restaurant and the server brings out your dining companions food first and you just sit there while saying 'no, go ahead, eat it while it's hot' all the while being annoyed at the restaurant for not waiting until both meals were done prior to serving.

The problem was that my sample came back as 'insufficient dna'. Ok, not their fault. I put in the information to get the replacement kit within hours of receiving the email. It took over a week for it to arrive, way longer than the original kit took. I used it and mailed it back within the day. It took a week and a half for it to be received by them. No express shipping option even if I was willing to pay for it. It's now been two weeks since they received that kit back and over two months since the original kit was started. Still no results. I contacted them and was curtly told (in the form of a form letter) word to the effect of 'sorry to hear that but too bad, keep waiting and you'll eventually get results. It turns out redo kits are sent to the back of the line to wait all over again. Now with Father's Day gifts in the mix the wait is significantly longer than my first wait. They have my money, why should they make the effort to keep things moving quickly now?

I just can't recommend 23 and me. Once they get your money they could care less about anything else with the exception of endless emails trying to get you to fill out surveys with zero compensation so they can sell data.",2017-06-23 00:00:00

I also question the detailed info on the questionnaire that you must complete before testing. How much of the results are estimated by 23andme based your given information? I mean, geez--if I knew all the answers to their questions about my father, then I wouldn't be paying them to tell me!

It was interesting to see the genetic inclination factors for certain medical conditions (assuming that they're accurate). And the results did come in the stated time period. But other than that, I'm very disappointed.

UPDATE: I'm told that I'm mistaken, and that the results reflect a combination DNA.

If you're female, ancestry is worthless unless you don't know where a parent is from. If you do, you'll just get a general location, no specifics. For example, if you're European, it can narrow it down a sector but if you're of British ancestry it might pick up Viking or Norman genes since they invaded the UK way back, but it won't tell you that you have to read up on it from history.

The health part was kinda cool but mostly just random meaningless stuff like if you can smell something in pee or sneezing in the sun. Everything seems like hearsay bc nothing is certain. For example you are sensitive to caffeine it might say that you are likely to drink more caffeine than most others. Huh? Not very accurate.

This is a VERY starter type test for if you know nothing or have the money to throw at it for fun. In that case it's great. Maybe for guys it's better with that extra chromosome.

23andMe-DNA-Test-Ancestry-Personal,,Might as well flip a coin,Nicole McCleary,,,0,1.0,"The older I have gotten, the more interested I have become in learning about my ancestry. Over the years, my parents have told me where they think our ancestors are from, so I thought it would be fun to use one of these DNA test kits to confirm. If you're like me and looking for any sort of specific breakdown or confirmation of your ancestry, then this kit is likely not for you. If I could have given zero stars, I would have.

One positive is that I received my ancestry composition report in under two weeks. Since I tested right after Christmas, I expected to wait the full 6-8 weeks they state it could take to receive results because I assumed lots of people received these kits as gifts and would be eager to test, like me. I was pleasantly surprised that the results came back quickly.

At first glance, the report was exciting. It appeared to show my ancestry composition in a tidy and easy to read percentage list. But the more I reviewed my report, the more confused I became and the more questions I had. For example, the report as they sent it to me said I am a certain percentage ""French and German."" Yes, they lump the two into one category. It does not break it down more specifically to say I am actually this certain percentage French and this certain percentage German. I mean, I understand that France and Germany share a border in some places, but I think it is a mistake and makes it very unclear to the user how much French and how much German ancestry they really have.

I was also disappointed to see that a significant portion of my DNA is labeled in what 23andme calls Broadly Assigned Ancestry Groups. The explanation they give in their Frequently Asked Questions section is that if your DNA matches reference DNA from many different European countries, but none outside of Europe, for example, then they label your DNA Broadly European. In other words, either their algorithm or their reference database is unable to differentiate between the many, many countries in Europe, so they clump it all together and simply call you Broadly European. Such a population label is extremely underwhelming for someone looking to learn more about from where their ancestors hailed.

I could go on and on about my disappointments, but I'll get to my final point. As I continued to review my ancestry composition report, I noticed that near the bottom of the page in small font, there is a link giving users the ability to change the confidence level of the report. I will spare you the boring details, but if you don't know what confidence level is, look it up. It is extremely important. The confidence level of the ""detailed"" report they send you is set at a 50% confidence level. 50%!!! They themselves label this level of confidence ""speculative."" At 50% confidence, you yourself could pick any population group in the world and flip a coin to determine if your ancestors were from that area and you would be just as accurate as their report! Literally. That is not an exaggeration and it is not a lie. Look it up, educate yourselves. The worst part is that when I changed the confidence level to 90% (without going into detail, this means they are way more certain of the results than at 50%), my report changed DRAMATICALLY. Population categories where I was previously told I derived nearly 40% of my DNA dropped down to 2%. And the majority of my ancestry composition, over 90% to be precise, was lumped into the Broadly European category. Do you have any idea how many countries exist in Europe? Not to be insensitive, but I could have saved money and looked in the mirror to determine that I am of broadly European descent.

I simply cannot believe that more people are not taking issue with the confidence level. If you are looking at your report as they sent it to you (at 50% confidence level) and telling people about your ancestry composition based off of that, then you are simply speculating. Nothing more. I think it's actually very misleading that this company can even advertise that they can tell you a lot about your ancestry composition. In reality, they can tell you very few specifics.",2019-01-12 00:00:00

The results I received from 23&me were exactly what I expected with a very large percentage listed as Iberian. I really liked the medical tests and the information is easy to understand.",2019-01-03 00:00:00

I purchased the ancestry and health test; it was well worth it. I love it. I received it very fast from Amazon and the product is as described. I registered it right away, sent in my spit, and in about 3 weeks I received my results. The results I received were amazing. I would absolutely recommend 23andMe if you want to do a DNA test and the health section is worth getting. I found the health profile even more interesting than the ancestry profile. I highly recommend. Very cool.",2019-01-02 00:00:00

23andMe-DNA-Test-Ancestry-Personal,,"Crazy List Of Carrier Status, Worthless Plus Lack Of Paternial Information",Brenda ,,,0,2.0,"Took a while to get the results, I was very disappointed overall. I found out my heritage, but that was it. The carrier status list was bogus. Things I have never heard of before, lack of information on diseases that have been here for decades i.e. diabetes Type 1 & 2, SIDS, Specific Cancers, Multiple Births, and one I am not sure of that just showed up in my granddaughter has tuberous sclerosis complex and we have no idea who the carrier is. That one may be a new study I don't know, but the others have been around for decades and that is only a few that I would like to know. Then we to the ancestry and all I really know is where I originated at. My Maternal Haplogroup report I guess was complete. I really don't have any way of knowing. My Paternal had basic that everyone gets and nothing else. Said I had to get my Father or his relations to do tests to get any results. That is ridiculous and impossible since they are all deceased. All, but my Mother is gone and even she could not do it because she has dementia/Alzheimers and they can't tell where I stand with this. I know nothing about my ancestors and only have my Mom left. I wish I would have been told that they were only able to test against (provided a list of their carrier traits tested for) and that you needed family available to really do your ancestry. For me, it was a total waste of money. I have no information to pass on and no way to pursue anything. I am dead in the water. I feel not revealing this kind of information is unfair. Now if my husband wants to pursue his ancestors he can. He has both Maternal and Paternal information. Now the carrier part is the same on him. Of course we both we going to be negative on them all I had hoped for more because I did my research and this was by far the best reviewed. Not in my case. Sadly disappointed. Even with their reply to me. In my opinion, you take a risk with this. Could be good. Could be worthless. I would suggest you have at least two generations still living to do this. All this is just MOP. It is a reference to my experience for your review. Good Luck",2018-12-27 00:00:00
