Their website is a mess!\\nIn the first place, they don't really distinguish, when setting up your account, which questions are required to set up your account and which are voluntary to help them with research. That is frustrating. A person should be able to tend to the important agreements and know they're done with those and that their account is set up before being asked what probably amounts to (not exaggerating) 10-15 hours of health questions.\\nIn any case, realizing that somehow I'd gotten onto that treadmill and it wasn't going to end, I tried over the course of 3 days and put over 8 hours into attempting resolve a website glitch that would allow a person to choose whether they did or didn't want their sample stored for further research.\\n\\nI had friends over to see if they could figure out the problem. I called and wrote to customer service.- two different branches of the company - and they didn't seem to care. Their customer service is the worst! They just refer you to their website! By the time my sample had arrived at the company, it was too late to change anything (although I did spend another 2 hours trying to do so!)\\n\\nSo, basically, if you're having trouble with the website, they say: Go to the website!\\n\\nSpecifically, I'd say, \"Hey, I'm having trouble with this link. It's not taking me to the page where I can choose to have my sample stored! My friends have come over to see if I'm an idiot or what the problem is, we've spent hours and hours trying to solve this... Here's the browser I'm using, blah, blah...\" and probably no less than 15 times, I was referred to the link that wasn't working, or a different one that linked to it and then asked to rate their customer service!\"\\n\\nIt was infuriating!\\n\\nI've ordered this for myself and two other members of my family - I ordered theirs first as gifts - so I was obligated to use 23andMe but they're are just really bad at the business end; which is probably typical for a company run by scientists.</td>\n",

I still not have received mine though it is, just barely, still within the timeline of 6-8 weeks.\\n\\nThat said, I've viewed the results for my husband and it's very interesting to look through. I think we knew what we were going to see and weren't surprised to get the results he did. The predisposition to diseases was at least an interesting read, though they stress that environment and other factors play a big role in your chances of actually acquiring any of the mentioned diseases/disorders.\\n\\nUPDATE: On the first day over 8 weeks, I sent an email to customer support saying that I hadn't seen any progress from essentially step 2 after they receive it and just wanted an update. I received a very courteous response saying that they were moving my sample to the front and that I would be receiving a free code for another kit! I received my results on Feb 14th - almost 10 weeks later. I definitely expected a little delay since I sent in around the holidays and really wasn't in any hurry since the data wasn't going to change, just very curious. I appreciate the fantastic customer service. I've read that people are very frustrated with them when they email before the 8 weeks demanding updates, but that is what the slider on the homepage is for - to provide updates.

For me, I got 99.9% South Asian. Are you kidding me? I could have said that without a $200 DNA test. For a population of over 1.3 billion people in India alone, 23andme can't find a proper DNA analysis for this population? Are they THAT lazy? For British Isles, or other small islands in Europe they could provide a detailed analysis of it including tiny regions.\\n\\nI did a Genographic Project DNA test two years ago and that was more detailed that 23andme's terrible DNA result. 40% South East Asian, 30% South West Asian, 14% Mediterranean, 4% Northern European among others.

Mine was straight 50/50, so there was no ambiguity about it. The results are further broken down into specific global regions of your ancestry origins. I found it to be extremely helpful. The traits, diseases and other information was also straightforward and easy to read. It's a quality kit with fantastic information. I've had suspicions about my ancestral origins, and the results proved them correct. What I really liked was the results pinpointed on a time line, specific years of ancestry, so you can plot migration patterns. Mine went back to the 1700's Native Americans, then migrated out to Eastern Asia around 1800. It mentioned my 3rd or 4th grandfather was most likely from a specific region of a specific country, and the approximate years he was alive. Very cool! BUY IT.

If you ever need to call them you get outsourced call service which I honestly did not even waste my time with and automatically asked for someone in the states. Luckily my sample only ran in to two delays, both of which were fixed within about a week each so not as horrible as some other people. Do expect this to take the full 6-8 weeks they ask for though you might get lucky and get it in 4. They do seem to have resolved their issues though and are catching back up so this may no longer be an issue. Do I still recommend this? Yes if you have patience and time to let the sample run its course how ever long it takes. The results are awesome.

Cherokees sued for peace. never again attacked settlers as as tribe. The battle was remembered as the Running Waters, Cave and Lookout mountain campaign.\\nMartin settled in the Sequatchie Valley in 1815.

But, then, we waited and waited....my husband's results never showed up. They said that after 8 weeks they would investigate to see if was a problem with his sample. It's now been 9 weeks and we can't get a response. If we were judging from my husband's experience alone, it would be zero stars. Understandable that things happen and estimated times aren't always accurate, NOT acceptable that they won't respond to our requests, even though it's exactly what they told us to do. So, it's 2 stars, since I'm happy with my own experience we'll average it out.</td>\n",

My mom was up front with me about what happened back in 1964 and she had an idea of who it was but wasn’t positive. Taking this DNA test confirmed who he was. I’ve since been in touch with a cousin 23andMe matched me with and was able to get pics of my grandmother and great grandmother on my dad’s side. It was very exciting! Her dad was my dad’s cousin. Unfortunately, he lost all the pics he had of them in a flood. I looked for my dad and discovered he passed away back in 1994 so that was disappointing. I would have loved to know more about him. My mom passed before I took this test and she would have been so happy to know I found family. If you are reading this review and wondering if you should try it, please do! It’s fun to see where all the people are in the world who share DNA with you! It’s wild to be 52 and finally learn who your dad is!</td>\n",

       "0   The DNA test itself is fine and useful IF you are looking for DNA relatives or you buy and upload results to promethease.com, which will tell you everything that is published on SNPedia about your genes and is only $5.00; BUT the company 23andme is a mess! Their website is a mess!\\nIn the first place, they don't really distinguish, when setting up your account, which questions are required to set up your account and which are voluntary to help them with research. That is frustrating. A person should be able to tend to the important agreements and know they're done with those and that their account is set up before being asked what probably amounts to (not exaggerating) 10-15 hours of health questions.\\nIn any case, realizing that somehow I'd gotten onto that treadmill and it wasn't going to end, I tried over the course of 3 days and put over 8 hours into attempting resolve a website glitch that would allow a person to choose whether they did or didn't want their sample stored for further research.\\n\\nI had friends over to see if they could figure out the problem. I called and wrote to customer service.- two different branches of the company - and they didn't seem to care. Their customer service is the worst! They just refer you to their website! By the time my sample had arrived at the company, it was too late to change anything (although I did spend another 2 hours trying to do so!)\\n\\nSo, basically, if you're having trouble with the website, they say: Go to the website!\\n\\nSpecifically, I'd say, \"Hey, I'm having trouble with this link. It's not taking me to the page where I can choose to have my sample stored! My friends have come over to see if I'm an idiot or what the problem is, we've spent hours and hours trying to solve this... Here's the browser I'm using, blah, blah...\" and probably no less than 15 times, I was referred to the link that wasn't working, or a different one that linked to it and then asked to rate their customer service!\"\\n\\nIt was infuriating!\\n\\nI've ordered this for myself and two other members of my family - I ordered theirs first as gifts - so I was obligated to use 23andMe but they're are just really bad at the business end; which is probably typical for a company run by scientists.  \n",
       "1   Timelines are a little wonky. I sent mine in and it was received December 7th. My husbands was received December 8th. His results came in on around January 15th. I still not have received mine though it is, just barely, still within the timeline of 6-8 weeks.\\n\\nThat said, I've viewed the results for my husband and it's very interesting to look through. I think we knew what we were going to see and weren't surprised to get the results he did. The predisposition to diseases was at least an interesting read, though they stress that environment and other factors play a big role in your chances of actually acquiring any of the mentioned diseases/disorders.\\n\\nUPDATE: On the first day over 8 weeks, I sent an email to customer support saying that I hadn't seen any progress from essentially step 2 after they receive it and just wanted an update. I received a very courteous response saying that they were moving my sample to the front and that I would be receiving a free code for another kit! I received my results on Feb 14th - almost 10 weeks later. I definitely expected a little delay since I sent in around the holidays and really wasn't in any hurry since the data wasn't going to change, just very curious. I appreciate the fantastic customer service. I've read that people are very frustrated with them when they email before the 8 weeks demanding updates, but that is what the slider on the homepage is for - to provide updates. If it gets past 8 weeks, then ask what's up.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",
       "2   For my white partner, the results are so detailed - X% welsh, Y%english, Z% scottish, catalan, french, Italian sardinian(?) etc etc. He had so much detailed description of where his ancestry is from. 23andme has Sardinian(?) in their results (unbelievable) but you categorize an entire population as South Asian. For me, I got 99.9% South Asian. Are you kidding me? I could have said that without a $200 DNA test. For a population of over 1.3 billion people in India alone, 23andme can't find a proper DNA analysis for this population? Are they THAT lazy? For British Isles, or other small islands in Europe they could provide a detailed analysis of it including tiny regions.\\n\\nI did a Genographic Project DNA test two years ago and that was more detailed that 23andme's terrible DNA result. 40% South East Asian, 30% South West Asian, 14% Mediterranean, 4% Northern European among others. Not only that, I was 2% Neanderthal and 3% Denisovan.\\n\\nNone of these results were on 23andme. Just 99.9% South Asian. I could have looked in the mirror to know that.\\n\\nSorry about my language, but that's what it is. A LAZY DNA test. Such a waste of my money and time.\\n\\nI will not recommend 23andme to anybody. It's so White Anglo Saxon centric. 23andme should invest some more money for research of different population samples before going around advertising their product further.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",
       "3   What a wonderful product. It is so easy to do, you just spit into a tube, fill it to a line, cap it, then send it off! My results came back in about seven weeks, and was surprisingly very accurate. It seems that the more diverse your ancestral profile is, the less satisfaction you'll have with it. Mine was straight 50/50, so there was no ambiguity about it. The results are further broken down into specific global regions of your ancestry origins. I found it to be extremely helpful. The traits, diseases and other information was also straightforward and easy to read. It's a quality kit with fantastic information. I've had suspicions about my ancestral origins, and the results proved them correct. What I really liked was the results pinpointed on a time line, specific years of ancestry, so you can plot migration patterns. Mine went back to the 1700's Native Americans, then migrated out to Eastern Asia around 1800. It mentioned my 3rd or 4th grandfather was most likely from a specific region of a specific country, and the approximate years he was alive. Very cool! BUY IT. I consider myself lucky to be living in a time where such technology is available and affordable.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",
       "4   So I bought this on the Amazon Prime day special. Instructions were easy enough, (Need more spit that you would think... lol) Registration is a bit involved but thorough and easy enough. Now here is where it gets a bit crappy. 23andme outsources the testing to LabCorp (for multiple and legit reasons that is actually beneficial to you the customer) though they had some security issues that required some down time which meant some holdups on processing, some redirecting of packages to another lab, etc... though they are horrible about communicating these delays and just give you cookie cutter responses instead of an honest explanation as to what is going on. If you ever need to call them you get outsourced call service which I honestly did not even waste my time with and automatically asked for someone in the states. Luckily my sample only ran in to two delays, both of which were fixed within about a week each so not as horrible as some other people. Do expect this to take the full 6-8 weeks they ask for though you might get lucky and get it in 4. They do seem to have resolved their issues though and are catching back up so this may no longer be an issue. Do I still recommend this? Yes if you have patience and time to let the sample run its course how ever long it takes. The results are awesome. If you need quick turn around time though I hear ancestry.com DNA is significantly faster.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",
       "5   Firstly, I paid the higher price to have the health screening done, it took me months to decide if I wanted this due to having family medical conditions. When I got my results back there is no medical history and they said that I did not pay for this. But they are happy to give me the results if I pay $120 more...\\n\\nI also do not trust my results at all. There results that are coming up are showing me only one last name ( out of 977 results) that is familiar on my list of relatives. It’s Clark. It doesn’t show that I have any Native American or Scottish ancestry even though my mom is atleast 80% Scottish.\\n\\nIt took three weeks to get the test back (end of June) when I was expecting it in August. I called the help line and it goes straight to a man in India that barely could understand me and said there is no way any mistakes could be made.

       "6   This DNA test from 23andMe gives you a huge amount of raw data. If you're looking for medical information (not just ancestry), you are getting your money's worth. However, due to FDA regulations, they aren't allowed to interpret it for you beyond some very basic (and frankly unhelpful) reports. This is true for all DNA testing companies when it comes to medical information. The good news is that you can upload your 23andMe data to other websites and receive detailed reports. Promethease.com gives you detailed reporting for just $5 - everything from vulnerabilities to diseases, to genes associated with personality traits. Another commenter mentioned the MTHFR mutations, which are associated with many chronic illnesses. Geneticgenie.org will run your 23andMe results specifically related to these genes, and the report is free. And if you can afford it, the best way to interpret your results is to make an appointment with a genetic counselor, who you can find through NSGC.org. So, you're paying for the data with this test, and it's just a few extra steps to understand the data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",
       "7   5 stars based on gender accuracy. It's a girl! And sure enough my genetic blood testing confirmed.\\n\\n4 stars for the blood collection process.\\n\\nImprovements would include instructions outside of the box so you can read what the process entails prior to collection. Even if they are printed on the box still sealed.\\n\\nMy biggest issue was the collection vial didn't have a distinct edge/lip where u can scrape the blood off your finger. Mine took 3 pricks before I got good blood flow and by then it was sticky and clotting. I couldn't scrape the blood into the vial bc there was was a thin blood bubble blocking it and blood was running everywhere but into the collection vial. It was a total mess bc of this. However, maybe had I done the prick on the outside of my ring finger first it would have gone a lot smoother and avoiding this issue entirely.\\n\\nOverall, I would purchase again since the results were accurate in my case.\\n\\nTip: With my experience my ring finger, on the side by my pinky in the fatty part, was the best place to prick.\\n\\nGood Luck.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",
       "8   A family history story indicates that from 1790 to 1815 the Ashburn family line fought Cherokees (Chicamauga). Martin Ashburn was an Ensign in the Knox Regiment of volunteers that destroyed the Chicamaugas in the Fall of 1794. Group of 500 men pursued a group of renegades that had  murdered settlers along the Holston and French Broad Rivers after receiving from George Washington ~ $5,000 under a treaty agreement. The Group elected James Ore the commander who was Martin A.â€™s brother-in-law. president Washington wanted only the miscreants punished. group arrived near present day Chattanooga on the North side of the Tennessee River and were about to return home empty handed when a white captive living with the Chicamaugas for seven years (16yrs old) offered to help the Group engage the Indians by surprise. Cherokees sued for peace. never again attacked settlers as as tribe. The battle was remembered as the Running Waters, Cave and Lookout mountain campaign.\\nMartin settled in the Sequatchie Valley in 1815. Hid grandson and namesake married a full blood Cherokee woman named Mary Hawkins in 1841 and moved on to former Indian Land near Lookout Mountain in Alabama. Martin and Mary had many children. among them my grandfather William Lafayette Ashburn.

       "9   What a waste of money! First you are prompted to answer a bunch of questions regarding your family medical history, which I did. Then you are prompted to answer a bunch of other questions what are then \"determined\" when you get your test results. \"Surprisingly\", my DNA results indicated that I didn't have the markers for any of the diseases that I marked as negative when I filled out my questionnaire. Your ancestry will then be grouped so broadly that it won't answer any of your questions. I'm \"European\"? Not a big surprise. I'm also\" British and Irish\", which they grouped together. I wanted a test that would break the results down specifically. ALSO the test results were completely OPPOSITE of the results from the National Geographic DNA test, which broke everything down. I got MUCH, MUCH, MUCH more information from the National Geographic DNA test which breaks down the routes your ancestors took then this 23 and ME test which basically parroted back the info that I answered on the initial questionnaire.

How can they find you are .6% Iberian but miss 31% Native American raises doubts on the validity of their small data base and at best their speculative results.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",
       "11  I am very disappointed with 23 and Me. I have tested with other companies prior to purchasing the 23and Me DNA Test - Health + Ancestry. I had good results from the other DNA tests but I wanted to test with 23and Me for the Health reports. I purchased my kit on 11/24/17 and received the test kit on 11/29/17. The kit was received at their lab on 12/6/2017. On 2/18/18 I received an email stating “our laboratory attempted analysis of your saliva sample but the concentration of DNA was insufficient to produce genotyping results”. They sent a replacement kit on 2/20/2018. They received my second saliva sample in their lab on 03/01/2018. I did this time reach out to their Customer Service Department a few times regarding the status of my test as I was not feeling too confident in them at this point. As suspected, I received an email on 4/2/2018 stating “They could not successfully analyze the second saliva sample for the same reason that produced the first analysis failure, the concentration of DNA in the saliva sample was insufficient.” They would not send another kit but they would refund my money. My frustration with them is that I had sent a saliva sample to another company and they were able to extract my DNA with no problems. I originally never thought of the possibility that the test would fail. I was shocked. I do not recommend the 23andMe DNA Test!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",
       "12  It’s an attractive application, but its functionality as far as user autonomy/interaction is low. There is no in-app messaging feature (so connecting/staying connected with DNA relatives is difficult). If you message a relative and they message you back, if the app doesn’t notify you that they responded (and it doesn’t always), you won’t know that person has messaged you unless you circumnavigate the labyrinth of features back to that particular user’s DNA profile. Another one of the biggest failures of this app is that it does not orient based on how you’re holding your mobile device. It only works if you’re holding your mobile device upright. So if you are using a tablet on its side, the app doesn’t adjust to that orientation. Overall, all it really does is passively allow you to absorb colorful information with your mobile device when you’re holding said device in an upright orientation. Don’t expect to be able to interact with the application or actively use any of the information with it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",
       "13  I will tell everyone I know how bad this was. I have a masters degree in healthcare, manage medical clinics, and neither me or the doctors I work with could make any sense of the nonsense they sent me for results. They were completely vague with little usable information. I also ordered a kit for my son-after 16 weeks, they said they could not send me results and blamed the sample! This is NOT rocket science. My son knows how to spit into a tube! I am 95% sure that this happened because my son has a lot of different backgrounds, and they didn't have the database to process the results and then try to blame \"the spit\". Then they were rude, hard to contact, and when I then demanded a refund, they sent me a link to request a refund, but when you click the link it said \"page not found\".

Also, they are not able to report Spanish Moorish DNA at all, and even their Jewish percentages seem questionable.\\n\\nNot sure it is very useful for Hispanic people.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",
       "16  Its fascinating to know where your ancestors were living. I am 100% European and that is almost completely northern European with the largest part from Ireland and Britain. My maternal ancestry goes back to the Caspian Sea area This information has spurred an interest in learning now about the history of my unknown ancestors in the British Isles. Unfortunately the company is not legally allowed to give any information about possible genetic links to illness. Imo that information should be given to us. The company will however automatically update your information if new data becomes available. So if the government will allow it, in the future there may be information made available about possible health issues linked to genetics.\\n\\nOh and genetically I am 2.6% neanderthal :)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",
       "17  App is bare bones no where near the functionality of the 23andMe website. Design is only really applicable for iPhone. It runs on iPads as an iPhone app. 23andMe should  devote some time to expanding the app to run on iPads and making use of the expansive display real estate the iPad offers.

If they were wrong about just a couple of things it would have been ok, but that is not the case. Of the twenty something traits the got 10 wrong. As far as my ancestory 2 other tests show 12% Spanish while nothing from the iberian peninsula came up on this. Do I at least trust the health report and carrier status. Nope I have 1 decease they say I am not carrier for. Also, the reports read like a weather report. You have a high percentage of having blue eyes. Mine hazel to the brown gold side. There is a 50% chance it may rain. I think I could have been happier spending this amount of money on an online psychic.

       "19  Very thorough analysis of regional ancestry and the likelihood of various genetic medical conditions and physical traits. The descriptions for each aspect are concise with reference to a complete explanation and an opportunity to \"meet\" your genetic relatives. Our results closely matched what we knew of our families, but offered a few things we didn't know as well. The end product was both enjoyable and informative. I hope and expect that as more is learned about the genetic markers for aspects not covered in our analysis, that 23 and Me will disseminate this within their customer base.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",
       "20  SUPER straightforward. I was worried this would be some strange medical process or take lots of time, but the whole process took ~10 mins from unboxing.\\n\\nThe process is simple: you get a box with a couple of cotton swabs and container. You swab the inside of each cheek for a minute or two, stick the cotton into the provided safe containers, and then mail it back with the box and postage, all provided by vitagene.\\n\\nThen you wait for your results, which come ~4 weeks later. They cover everything from ancestry to potential health issues.\\n\\nOverall very satisfied with the process and results.

Results: company reported that I was at increased risk for four serious diseases, all of which I had or subsequently developed and am receiving treatment for. Had I known sooner, there were actions I could have taken to avoid or delay two of the four. I bought kits for all my children who learned that they were at increased risk for two of the same diseases I had. This allows them to choose to take preventive action.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",

       "25  Apparently my saliva doesn’t have enough dna to be able to be analyzed. I was bummed because I really wanted to use 23&me. I followed the directions closely both times and shipped out immediately. I read this happens to a few people. Maybe cheek swab testing companies have better results. After the second fail, I was no longer allowed to try again and my only option was to request a refund. By doing so, 23&me states I can never submit a sample in the future. Which is annoying... what if their tech gets better or start collecting dna differently? I feel like I got banned.\\nReally wanted to love this, but it just didn’t work for me.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",
       "26  Don't be deceived by the 4-8 weeks. It will take you much longer and by that time, you won't even have any interest left of the result cause you're going to be exhausted and stressed out. Same replies from the customer service that it's a complicated process and even they don't know when the results will be ready. No proper apologies for the delay, just keep on saying be calm and wait for the result. If it's okay for you to pay $130 and get something after 3 months then go for it (could take more than 3 months, who knows). Oh yeah and there are possibilities that your saliva couldn't be analyzed due to \"insufficient amount of data\" which they never will tell you before purchasing. In that case, you have to go through the 3 month process all over again which will roughly be half a year. Good luck with that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",
       "27  I received this gift right after Christmas and was super excited. I did the test, registered the barcode and shipped it off. That was the 28th of December. I am still waiting for the results 97 days later and according to the oh so helpful website I am still a long way from getting results. I tried the email \"customer service\"(I use that term somewhat jokingly). Nothing but emails telling me that they had received the package and were working on it. And working on it. And working on it. Still no results going on 3 and a half months. I will post an update if I ever actually receive the results. Given how long it is taking I don't have much faith that I am going to get anything accurate.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",

       "29  My biological father was a sperm donor 25 years ago. So, I took this DNA test because I only knew about half of my family history. I wanted to know if I was a carrier for any traits that my father might have passed on to me. I just wanted a better medical history. It turns out, I found my paternal grandfather and he connected me to my biological father.

       "31  Ive t aged with this company and Ancestry DNA so far. I have also used other websites where I uploaded my raw DNA data to get more matches, and more information. I learned that 23andMe tends to miss relative matches in your list of matches, and their health test is a joke! Save your money, and wait until you do just the autosomal test, then upload your raw DNA data to promethease.com or you could get VitaGene. Their testing for both the Ancestry and the health reports is about the same cost as doing just the Ancestry testing. Shop around, ask your friends and family what their experiences were. While 23andMe does have some cool stuff, it really isn't as good as the others.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
       "32  First of all, the customer service department is AMAZING. All my questions were answered thoroughly, fast, and they were extremely nice. My kit came in the mail quickly, and was very easy to activate. It even came with a pre-paid postage to send back which was awesome. The instructions were easily readable, but its the result that is mind blowing. You basically get a 50-something page book all about you, so basically its like kindergarten all over again! I found out that I'm more made up of my dad, when my whole life I thought I was more of my mom! 67% Irish, and I found out I even have some asian and southern American in me too! I actually signed up for the supplement part after finding out I was low in vitamins D & A, and I feel so amazing after taking them. I highly recommend checking out this company!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",
       "33  I wasn't sure about doing this test but I had a strong interest in my health profile more so than my ancestry. The use of the kit was easy and all the directions were well explained. I bought this product with a sale and I will say it was worth it. It took some time (weeks) before I got the information back. It was very interesting to see all the details about genetic diseases, personal characteristics and ancestry. There are lots of questionaires on the website that take some time. I guess this helps them study people's genetic profiles. I did not participate in many of them. You also have the option to stay private, which I did. I later decided I wanted to see people who shared my dna. I'm glad I had the option although it is really hard to understand all the familial connections.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",

It only gives you a region and a percentage, not the actual country that your ancestors are from. Totally worthless report.\\n\\nThis company is a vitamin & supplement company.

At any rate, I have essentially no Native American DNA so she is vindicated!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",
       "36  I am so happy with this! I got my results right after Christmas. I placed my raw data file in Prometheus and saw that I was at risk for blood clots. So I went to the Dr because I wasn't feeling well and told her about my results. She did a test and they found high amounts of the protein that gets rid of blood clots. This thing helped me know I need to get serious about my health because it is true stuff you're reading! The ancestry part was spot on and very surprising at the same time! The actual information you get from the company is limited and not what I expected, but... When the raw data is placed in to another processor, like Prometheus, it is amazing. You can do this with your ancestry kit as well.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",
       "37  I did a lot of research on which DNA test to use, and I kept coming back to this one. I'm very happy with it! 23andMe has an amazing web interface, you learn a lot about your genetic background, and can also contribute to research by other parties via surveys about diets, sleeping habits, etc. They add new results once or twice a year as well. And if you want to know even more about yourself, you can upload the raw data from your results to third party websites that break things down even further.\\n\\nI like this company because I feel like they are constantly evolving, rather than offering a once-over service that never gives you anything else.

       "38  This is a great product. I've yet to send my sample in but know from seeing the results a nephew received and reviewing the results he got with the results i got from the ancestry DNA results that you receive much more detailed information from these results then ancestors DNA results. Yet to be fair ancestry DNA results I received were from a few years back and am sure they have collected and are able to perform more details then they had when I used it. I am very excited to see my results with 23and Me and know that the more family that take this DNA or any DNA product the better my over all results will be. I look forward to comparing my results with my nephew and as will be purchasing one for my mother to compare her results with ours. Again I give this 5 stars for the detailed results and ease of using there software to compare my results with others. Ancestry DNA test i give 4 stars to for the same reasons.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",
       "39  Was a bit disappointed about the information you receive from your results. I was under the impression that it would tell you details on each family member you are related too. It just says ur relationship and how much dna u share. Doesn’t explain how u are related. The health portion was lacking not much useful information. I ened up buying an ancestry dna kit to find more about my family roots and find other family members. The 23&me just tells me where I’m from and few health questions. I wouldn’t recommend it , I was rather disappointed. If ur wanting family connections this isn’t the correct test.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",
       "40  This Business Is Not BBB Accredited - it has tons of complaints thru the Better Business Bureau and Consumer Complaints. They take too long to process and the results are vague. Response from 23andMe indicate that their \"gene pool\" is not yet big enough to get more detailed Ancestry results. So if you want to know exactly what part of Mexico or Spain your family is from, like I do, you're not going to get that answer. Their Health DNA is pretty crappy too...it looks like the same template that they send to everyone. All in all, not impressed. Maybe they should partner up with Ancestry.com and share the results to increase the gene pool and get better results. Not worth $130...not worth waiting nearly 5 months for vague results.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",
       "41  Satisfied with DNA results but the health DNA extra is very little. Not what I expected. I just wish they would include a BRCA report. I would like to know if I carry the gene for breast cancer. I communicated with 23andMe and they told me the FDA won't allow any company to provide this report at this time. Why? It adds up to one thing - \"Money.\" The FDA and the companies able to provide BRCA reports won't get kickbacks or reimbursement.

       "42  eh, not really worth anything.\\n\\nSince I don't have parents (well, I suppose they're somewhere) I wanted to know a bit about my ancestry. I guess this did an adequate job in that regard, telling me approximate locations of ancestors. Fair enough, so not a total ripoff.\\n\\nThe rest of it is just nonsense. I \"may or may not be likely\" about 1000 other things which seemed to be wrong most of the time. They really can tell you nothing else. Frankly, the uselessness and vagueness of the rest of these things makes me question the accuracy of their ancestor location data. You will get no useful information from any of it.\\n\\nI got this at half price which still seems too much, but at least I'm somewhat convinced about my ancestry.

       "43  I bought this kit to take advantage of the Black Friday special. As soon as I received it I followed the easy instructions to collect the sample by swabbing the inside of my cheek and then sent it off. I registered online and filled out the questionaire. Within about 5 weeks my results were in my online profile. I loved finally learning my ancestry and have already started making changes to my eating habits based on the nutrition info that came back. Very insightful and now my friends and family all want to try it!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",
       "44  My husband and I ordered two of these, one for each of us. We sent them in and within 4 weeks, I had my results. At that point I would've given them a high 5 score! But, then, we waited and waited....my husband's results never showed up. They said that after 8 weeks they would investigate to see if was a problem with his sample. It's now been 9 weeks and we can't get a response. If we were judging from my husband's experience alone, it would be zero stars. Understandable that things happen and estimated times aren't always accurate, NOT acceptable that they won't respond to our requests, even though it's exactly what they told us to do. So, it's 2 stars, since I'm happy with my own experience we'll average it out.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",
       "45  I actually received my kit as a Christmas gift. I grew up not knowing who my dad was. My mom was up front with me about what happened back in 1964 and she had an idea of who it was but wasn’t positive. Taking this DNA test confirmed who he was. I’ve since been in touch with a cousin 23andMe matched me with and was able to get pics of my grandmother and great grandmother on my dad’s side. It was very exciting! Her dad was my dad’s cousin. Unfortunately, he lost all the pics he had of them in a flood. I looked for my dad and discovered he passed away back in 1994 so that was disappointing. I would have loved to know more about him. My mom passed before I took this test and she would have been so happy to know I found family. If you are reading this review and wondering if you should try it, please do! It’s fun to see where all the people are in the world who share DNA with you! It’s wild to be 52 and finally learn who your dad is!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",
       "46  This is the buggiest app I have used in a long while. How this got into the App Store is beyond me. It says my report is ready and view it. I sat view and it wants me to answer a few questions. Then locks up on second question. So I hit skip survey and it says I canâ€™t skip it. So why do you have a skip button. The old app worked fine. Not sure why they destroyed it. There should be a class action lawsuit for the app developers too.\\nMy parents got a 23 and me kit for Christmas and I thought I would show them my report and was embarrassed how bad the app worked they were questioning if they should even use the kit.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",
       "47  Complete and total WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY. Told me only that I had 97 or 98% northeastern European ancestry; nothing more specific. I could have told anybody that earlier, without the DNA test, from what I know about my grandparents. A friend of mine took the DNA test from a competing company, and that company was able to nail down the specific country from which his ancestors originated. To add injury to insult, a couple of weeks after both my wife and I purchased these DNA kits, this company temporarily dropped the price of the kits by $50 each. Total disgusting waste.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",
       "48  More of a humorous party anecdote than useful information for me, any way. I pretty much guessed/assumed years ago what it would later confirm to me. The health insight stuff is interesting but it guessed my attributes wrong (morning vs night person, ability to grow a beard, i have a full beard it said I would more than likely not be able to grow one.., my hair color was defiantly wrong and disappointing).\\n\\nOverall this, to me, was something more of a party anecdote.

None of us care what they do with our DNA after analysis and all have elected to have stored on ice for scientific research.

This is true for all DNA testing companies when it comes to medical information. The good news is that you can upload your 23andMe data to other websites and receive detailed reports. Promethease.com gives you detailed reporting for just $5 - everything from vulnerabilities to diseases, to genes associated with personality traits. Another commenter mentioned the MTHFR mutations, which are associated with many chronic illnesses. Geneticgenie.org will run your 23andMe results specifically related to these genes, and the report is free. And if you can afford it, the best way to interpret your results is to make an appointment with a genetic counselor, who you can find through NSGC.org.

Mine was straight 50/50, so there was no ambiguity about it. The results are further broken down into specific global regions of your ancestry origins. I found it to be extremely helpful. The traits, diseases and other information was also straightforward and easy to read. It's a quality kit with fantastic information. I've had suspicions about my ancestral origins, and the results proved them correct. What I really liked was the results pinpointed on a time line, specific years of ancestry, so you can plot migration patterns. Mine went back to the 1700's Native Americans, then migrated out to Eastern Asia around 1800. It mentioned my 3rd or 4th grandfather was most likely from a specific region of a specific country, and the approximate years he was alive. Very cool! BUY IT.

Now here is where it gets a bit crappy. 23andme outsources the testing to LabCorp (for multiple and legit reasons that is actually beneficial to you the customer) though they had some security issues that required some down time which meant some holdups on processing, some redirecting of packages to another lab, etc... though they are horrible about communicating these delays and just give you cookie cutter responses instead of an honest explanation as to what is going on. If you ever need to call them you get outsourced call service which I honestly did not even waste my time with and automatically asked for someone in the states. Luckily my sample only ran in to two delays, both of which were fixed within about a week each so not as horrible as some other people. Do expect this to take the full 6-8 weeks they ask for though you might get lucky and get it in 4. They do seem to have resolved their issues though and are catching back up so this may no longer be an issue. Do I still recommend this? Yes if you have patience and time to let the sample run its course how ever long it takes. The results are awesome.

I called and wrote to customer service.- two different branches of the company - and they didn't seem to care. Their customer service is the worst! They just refer you to their website! By the time my sample had arrived at the company, it was too late to change anything (although I did spend another 2 hours trying to do so!)\\n\\nSo, basically, if you're having trouble with the website, they say: Go to the website!\\n\\nSpecifically, I'd say, \"Hey, I'm having trouble with this link. It's not taking me to the page where I can choose to have my sample stored! My friends have come over to see if I'm an idiot or what the problem is, we've spent hours and hours trying to solve this... Here's the browser I'm using, blah, blah...\" and probably no less than 15 times, I was referred to the link that wasn't working, or a different one that linked to it and then asked to rate their customer service!\"\\n\\nIt was infuriating!\\n\\nI've ordered this for myself and two other members of my family - I ordered theirs first as gifts - so I was obligated to use 23andMe but they're are just really bad at the business end; which is probably typical for a company run by scientists.</td>\n",

       "1  This DNA test from 23andMe gives you a huge amount of raw data. If you're looking for medical information (not just ancestry), you are getting your money's worth. However, due to FDA regulations, they aren't allowed to interpret it for you beyond some very basic (and frankly unhelpful) reports. This is true for all DNA testing companies when it comes to medical information. The good news is that you can upload your 23andMe data to other websites and receive detailed reports. Promethease.com gives you detailed reporting for just $5 - everything from vulnerabilities to diseases, to genes associated with personality traits. Another commenter mentioned the MTHFR mutations, which are associated with many chronic illnesses. Geneticgenie.org will run your 23andMe results specifically related to these genes, and the report is free. And if you can afford it, the best way to interpret your results is to make an appointment with a genetic counselor, who you can find through NSGC.org. So, you're paying for the data with this test, and it's just a few extra steps to understand the data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",
       "2  What a wonderful product. It is so easy to do, you just spit into a tube, fill it to a line, cap it, then send it off! My results came back in about seven weeks, and was surprisingly very accurate. It seems that the more diverse your ancestral profile is, the less satisfaction you'll have with it. Mine was straight 50/50, so there was no ambiguity about it. The results are further broken down into specific global regions of your ancestry origins. I found it to be extremely helpful. The traits, diseases and other information was also straightforward and easy to read. It's a quality kit with fantastic information. I've had suspicions about my ancestral origins, and the results proved them correct. What I really liked was the results pinpointed on a time line, specific years of ancestry, so you can plot migration patterns. Mine went back to the 1700's Native Americans, then migrated out to Eastern Asia around 1800. It mentioned my 3rd or 4th grandfather was most likely from a specific region of a specific country, and the approximate years he was alive. Very cool! BUY IT. I consider myself lucky to be living in a time where such technology is available and affordable.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",
       "3  So I bought this on the Amazon Prime day special. Instructions were easy enough, (Need more spit that you would think... lol) Registration is a bit involved but thorough and easy enough. Now here is where it gets a bit crappy. 23andme outsources the testing to LabCorp (for multiple and legit reasons that is actually beneficial to you the customer) though they had some security issues that required some down time which meant some holdups on processing, some redirecting of packages to another lab, etc... though they are horrible about communicating these delays and just give you cookie cutter responses instead of an honest explanation as to what is going on. If you ever need to call them you get outsourced call service which I honestly did not even waste my time with and automatically asked for someone in the states. Luckily my sample only ran in to two delays, both of which were fixed within about a week each so not as horrible as some other people. Do expect this to take the full 6-8 weeks they ask for though you might get lucky and get it in 4. They do seem to have resolved their issues though and are catching back up so this may no longer be an issue. Do I still recommend this? Yes if you have patience and time to let the sample run its course how ever long it takes. The results are awesome. If you need quick turn around time though I hear ancestry.com DNA is significantly faster.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",
       "4  The DNA test itself is fine and useful IF you are looking for DNA relatives or you buy and upload results to promethease.com, which will tell you everything that is published on SNPedia about your genes and is only $5.00; BUT the company 23andme is a mess! Their website is a mess!\\nIn the first place, they don't really distinguish, when setting up your account, which questions are required to set up your account and which are voluntary to help them with research. That is frustrating. A person should be able to tend to the important agreements and know they're done with those and that their account is set up before being asked what probably amounts to (not exaggerating) 10-15 hours of health questions.\\nIn any case, realizing that somehow I'd gotten onto that treadmill and it wasn't going to end, I tried over the course of 3 days and put over 8 hours into attempting resolve a website glitch that would allow a person to choose whether they did or didn't want their sample stored for further research.\\n\\nI had friends over to see if they could figure out the problem. I called and wrote to customer service.- two different branches of the company - and they didn't seem to care. Their customer service is the worst! They just refer you to their website! By the time my sample had arrived at the company, it was too late to change anything (although I did spend another 2 hours trying to do so!)\\n\\nSo, basically, if you're having trouble with the website, they say: Go to the website!\\n\\nSpecifically, I'd say, \"Hey, I'm having trouble with this link. It's not taking me to the page where I can choose to have my sample stored! My friends have come over to see if I'm an idiot or what the problem is, we've spent hours and hours trying to solve this... Here's the browser I'm using, blah, blah...\" and probably no less than 15 times, I was referred to the link that wasn't working, or a different one that linked to it and then asked to rate their customer service!\"\\n\\nIt was infuriating!\\n\\nI've ordered this for myself and two other members of my family - I ordered theirs first as gifts - so I was obligated to use 23andMe but they're are just really bad at the business end; which is probably typical for a company run by scientists.
