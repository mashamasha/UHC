### Analyzing users' reviews 

# Analysis of users'reviews of Personal Health Record (PHR) mobile applications: Topic Modeling

The goal of this project is to identify the most desirable features of PHR mobile applications.
We approached this task by collecting users' reviews, dividing them into positive and negative and performing Topic Modeling (LDA) as implemented in Gensim.

Based on the results of our analysis, we provided recommendations to Marketing team on what needs to be considered when developing mobile PHR app. 


### Data: 
We collected reviews of 18 mobile apps of UHG's competitors (e.g., Aetna, BlueSHield, Humana etc.) from Apple AppStore and Google Play in a programmatic way.
