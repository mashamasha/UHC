### Project 1
### Analysis of users' reviews of Personal Health Record (PHR) mobile applications: Topic Modeling

The goal of this project was to identify the most desirable features of PHR mobile applications.
We approached this task by collecting users' reviews, splitting them into positive and negative reviews based on rating and performing Topic Modeling (LDA) as implemented in Gensim.

As a result, we determinmed what features users are talking about most and provided recommendations to Marketing team on what features should be consider most important for developing its own PHR app.

__Data:__
We collected 6118 reviews across 25 Health and PHR apps (e.g., Aetna Mobile, Kaiser Permanente, Anthem Anywhere etc.) gathered from Apple Appstore and Google Play in a programmatic way.

### Project 2
### Analysis of users' reviews of DNA Health kits: Topic Modeling

The goal of this project was to gather and analyze user-feedback from various DNA test health kits available on Amazon.com and apps and determine specifically what features users and talking about most

We provided insights into what product/service features reviewers find valuable and what are their concerns about using DNA health kits. 

__Data:__
We collected 2339 total user reviews across 5 DNA test health kits gathered from Amazon.com 
(23anMe, CellMaxLife, TellmeGen, Color Heriditary Cancer Test, Color Genetic Risk Test)
